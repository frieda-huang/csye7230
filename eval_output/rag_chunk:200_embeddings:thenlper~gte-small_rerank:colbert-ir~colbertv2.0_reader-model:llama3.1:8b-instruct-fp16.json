When using chat templates as input for model generation, it's also a good idea\nto use `add_generation_prompt=True` to add a [generation prompt](#what-are-generation-prompts). \n\nHere's an example of preparing input for `model.generate()`, using the `Zephyr` assistant model:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer",

If the original repository shows examples where\n  you have to input a string, then try to find out where in the forward call the string input is changed to input ids\n  and start from this point. This might mean that you have to possibly write a small script yourself or change the\n  original code so that you can directly input the ids instead of an input string."

However, a major limitation of transformers-based models is its \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\) time & memory complexity (where \\\\(n\\\\) is sequence length). Hence, it's computationally very expensive to apply transformer-based models on long sequences \\\\(n > 512\\\\). Several recent papers, *e.g.* `Longformer`, `Performer`, `Reformer`, `Clustered attention` try to remedy this problem by approximating the full attention matrix. You can checkout \ud83e\udd17's recent blog [post](https://huggingface.co/blog/long-range-transformers) in case you are unfamiliar with these models.",
      "The Reformer pushes the limit of longe sequence modeling by its ability to process up to half a million tokens at once as shown in this [demo](https://github.com/patrickvonplaten/notebooks/blob/master/PyTorch_Reformer.ipynb). As a comparison, a conventional `bert-base-uncased` model limits the input length to only 512 tokens. In Reformer, each part of the standard transformer architecture is re-engineered to optimize for minimal memory requirement without a significant drop in performance.\n\nThe memory improvements can be attributed to **4** features which the Reformer authors introduced to the transformer world:",
      "*Many real-world applications require the prediction of long sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption planning. Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture",
      "The Reformer model as introduced by [Kitaev, Kaiser et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04451.pdf) is one of the most memory-efficient transformer models for long sequence modeling as of today.",

    "generated_answer": "When you pass multiple parameter groups to an optimizer with FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallelism) enabled, several parameter groups will be conflated into a single one due to nested module wrapping and parameter flattening. This is because FSDP auto-wraps sub-modules, flattens the parameters, and shards them in place, making it difficult for optimizers created before model wrapping to function properly.",

      "FSDP precisely addresses this by sharding the optimizer states, gradients and model parameters across the data parallel workers. It further facilitates CPU offloading of all those tensors, thereby enabling loading large models which won't fit the available GPU memory. Similar to DDP, each worker gets a different batch of data. During the forward pass, if the CPU offload is enabled, the parameters of the local shard are first copied to the GPU/accelerator. Then, each worker performs all-gather operation for a given FSDP wrapped module/layer(s) to all get the needed parameters, computation is performed followed by releasing/emptying the parameter shards of other workers. This continues for all the FSDP modules",
      "The above workflow gives an overview of what happens behind the scenes when FSDP is activated. Let's first understand how DDP works and how FSDP improves it. In DDP, each worker/accelerator/GPU has a replica of the entire model parameters, gradients and optimizer states. Each worker gets a different batch of data, it goes through the forwards pass, a loss is computed followed by the backward pass to generate gradients. Now, an all-reduce operation is performed wherein each worker gets the gradients from the remaining workers and averaging is done. In this way, each worker now has the same global gradients which are used by the optimizer to update the model parameters. We can see that having full replicas consume a lot of redundant memory on each GPU, which limits the batch size as well as the size of the models.",
      "Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP) is a paradigm in which the optimizer states, gradients and parameters are sharded across devices. During the forward pass, each FSDP unit performs an _all-gather operation_ to get the complete weights, computation is performed followed by discarding the shards from other devices. After the forward pass, the loss is computed followed by the backward pass. In the backward pass, each FSDP unit performs an all-gather operation to get the complete weights, with computation performed to get the local gradients. These local gradients are averaged and sharded across the devices via a _reduce-scatter operation_ so that each device can update the parameters of its shard",
      "## Next steps\n\nFSDP can be a powerful tool for training really large models and you have access to more than one GPU or TPU. By sharding the model parameters, optimizer and gradient states, and even offloading them to the CPU when they're inactive, FSDP can reduce the high cost of large-scale training. If you're interested in learning more, the following may be helpful:",
      "This is because parameter groups created before wrapping will have no meaning post wrapping due parameter flattening of nested FSDP modules into 1D arrays (which can consume many layers). For instance, below are the named parameters of FSDP model on GPU 0 (When using 2 GPUs. Around 55M (110M/2) params in 1D arrays as this will have the 1st shard of the parameters). Here, if one has applied no weight decay for [bias, LayerNorm.weight] named parameters of unwrapped BERT-Base model, it can\u2019t be applied to the below FSDP wrapped model as there are no named parameters with either of those strings and the parameters of those layers are concatenated with parameters of various other layers",
      "### **Few caveats to be aware of**\n\n- PyTorch FSDP auto wraps sub-modules, flattens the parameters and shards the parameters in place. Due to this, any optimizer created before model wrapping gets broken and occupies more memory. Hence, it is highly recommended and efficient to prepare model before creating optimizer.\u00a0`Accelerate`\u00a0will automatically wrap the model and create an optimizer for you in case of single model with a warning message.\n    \n    > FSDP Warning: When using FSDP, it is efficient and recommended to call prepare for the model before creating the optimizer\n    > \n\nHowever, below is the recommended way to prepare model and optimizer while using FSDP:"

    "generated_answer": "According to Document 0, the GPT-2 tokenizer replaces spaces with a specific token (`\u0120`).",
    "retrieved_docs": [
      "Like the GPT-2 tokenizer, this one keeps spaces and replaces them with a specific token (`_`), but the T5 tokenizer only splits on whitespace, not punctuation. Also note that it added a space by default at the beginning of the sentence (before `Hello`) and ignored the double space between `are` and `you`.\n\nNow that we've seen a little of how some different tokenizers process text, we can start to explore the underlying algorithms themselves. We'll begin with a quick look at the broadly widely applicable SentencePiece; then, over the next three sections, we'll examine how the three main algorithms used for subword tokenization work.\n\n## SentencePiece[[sentencepiece]]",
      ". Finally, let's see together on an example if it was useful to re-train a tokenizer similar to gpt2 one. With the original tokenizer of GPT-2 we see that all spaces are isolated and the method name \"randn\" relatively common in python code is split in 2. With our new tokenizer, single and double indentations have been learned and the method \"randn\" is tokenized into 1 token. And with that, you now know how to train your very own tokenizers!",
      "Since we're using a BERT tokenizer, the pre-tokenization involves splitting on whitespace and punctuation. Other tokenizers can have different rules for this step. For example, if we use the GPT-2 tokenizer:\n\n```py\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")\ntokenizer.backend_tokenizer.pre_tokenizer.pre_tokenize_str(\"Hello, how are  you?\")\n```\n\nit will split on whitespace and punctuation as well, but it will keep the spaces and replace them with a `\u0120` symbol, enabling it to recover the original spaces if we decode the tokens:",
      "1. GPT-2 uses [byte pair encoding (BPE)](tokenizer_summary#bytepair-encoding-bpe) to tokenize words and generate a token embedding. Positional encodings are added to the token embeddings to indicate the position of each token in the sequence. The input embeddings are passed through multiple decoder blocks to output some final hidden state. Within each decoder block, GPT-2 uses a *masked self-attention* layer which means GPT-2 can't attend to future tokens. It is only allowed to attend to tokens on the left. This is different from BERT's [`mask`] token because, in masked self-attention, an attention mask is used to set the score to `0` for future tokens.",

      "- Although the embedding matrix has a size of 50400, only 50257 entries are used by the GPT-2 tokenizer. These extra\n  tokens are added for the sake of efficiency on TPUs. To avoid the mismatch between embedding matrix size and vocab\n  size, the tokenizer for [GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) contains 143 extra tokens\n  `<|extratoken_1|>... <|extratoken_143|>`, so the `vocab_size` of tokenizer also becomes 50400.\n\n## Usage examples\n\nThe [`~generation.GenerationMixin.generate`] method can be used to generate text using GPT-J\nmodel.",
      "1. **Note on HF\u2019s transformers \u2014 padding token.** According to  ([transformers#2630#issuecomment-578159876](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/2630#issuecomment-578159876)), padding tokens were not used during the pre-training of GPT and GPT-2; therefore transformer\u2019s gpt2 models have no official padding token associated with its tokenizer. A common practice is to set `tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token`, but in this work, we shall distinguish these two special tokens to match OAI\u2019s original setting, so we will use `tokenizer.add_special_tokens({\"pad_token\": \"[PAD]\"})`."

In the \"Batching Inputs together\" video, we have seen that to be able to group inputs of different lengths in the same batch, we need to add padding tokens to all the short inputs until they are all of the same length. Here for instance, the longest sentence is the third one, and we need to add 5, 2 and 7 pad tokens to the other to have four sentences of the same lengths. When dealing with a whole dataset, there are various padding strategies we can apply. The most obvious one is to pad all the elements of the dataset to the same length: the length of the longest sample. This will then give us batches that all have the same shape determined by the maximum sequence length",
      "</Tip>\n\nBatching allows the model to work when you feed it multiple sentences. Using multiple sequences is just as simple as building a batch with a single sequence. There's a second issue, though. When you're trying to batch together two (or more) sentences, they might be of different lengths. If you've ever worked with tensors before, you know that they need to be of rectangular shape, so you won't be able to convert the list of input IDs into a tensor directly. To work around this problem, we usually *pad* the inputs.\n\n## Padding the inputs[[padding-the-inputs]]\n\nThe following list of lists cannot be converted to a tensor:\n\n```py no-format\nbatched_ids = [\n    [200, 200, 200],\n    [200, 200]\n]\n```",
      "The last thing we will need to do is pad all the examples to the length of the longest element when we batch elements together \u2014 a technique we refer to as *dynamic padding*.\n\n### Dynamic padding[[dynamic-padding]]\n\n<Youtube id=\"7q5NyFT8REg\"/>",
      "ow to batch inputs together? In this video, we will see how to batch input sequences together. In general, the sentences we want to pass through our model won't all have the same lengths. Here we are using the model we saw in the sentiment analysis pipeline and want to classify two sentences. When tokenizing them and mapping each token to its corresponding input IDs, we get two lists of different lengths. Trying to create a tensor or a NumPy array from those two lists will result in an error, because all arrays and tensors should be rectangular. One way to overcome this limit is to make the second sentence the same length as the first by adding a special token as many times as necessary",
      "sub-sequences together and then do the post-processing. This also fixes some offsets bugs.\n- [#236]: ByteLevel PostProcessor now uses the `add_prefix_space` attribute to determine how to\ntrim offsets.\n- Improved `TruncationError` to handle cases where provided max length is too low.\n- [#249]: `encode` and `encode_batch` input has been greatly improved, and it now also accept\npre-tokenized inputs.\n- Improved `TruncationError` to handle cases where provided max length is too low.\n- [#276]: Improve BPE training speeds, by reading files sequentially, but parallelizing the\nprocessing of each file",
      "- If you have no clue about the size of the sequence_length (\"natural\" data), by default don't batch, measure and\n    try tentatively to add it, add OOM checks to recover when it will fail (and it will at some point if you don't\n    control the sequence_length.)\n  - If your sequence_length is super regular, then batching is more likely to be VERY interesting, measure and push\n    it until you get OOMs.\n  - The larger the GPU the more likely batching is going to be more interesting\n- As soon as you enable batching, make sure you can handle OOMs nicely.\n\n## Pipeline chunk batching\n\n`zero-shot-classification` and `question-answering` are slightly specific in the sense, that a single input might yield\nmultiple forward pass of a model.

      "<Tip>\n\nNote that \ud83e\udd17 Transformers models have a special ability that most Keras models don't - they can automatically use an appropriate loss which they compute internally. They will use this loss by default if you don't set a loss argument in `compile()`. Note that to use the internal loss you'll need to pass your labels as part of the input, not as a separate label, which is the normal way to use labels with Keras models. You'll see examples of this in Part 2 of the course, where defining the correct loss function can be tricky. For sequence classification, however, a standard Keras loss function works fine, so that's what we'll use here.\n\n</Tip>\n\n```py\nfrom tensorflow.keras.losses import SparseCategoricalCrossentropy"

After you convert a model from (for example) PyTorch to Core ML, you can use it in your Swift apps. The Core ML framework automatically selects the best hardware to run your model on: the CPU, the GPU, or a specialized tensor unit called the Neural Engine. A combination of several of these compute units is also possible, depending on the characteristics of your system and the model details.\n\nTo see what it looks like to convert a model in real life, we'll look at converting the recently-released Llama 2 model.

      "## Overview\n\nThe XLNet model was proposed in [XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237) by Zhilin Yang, Zihang Dai, Yiming Yang, Jaime Carbonell, Ruslan Salakhutdinov,\nQuoc V.

      "formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into\npretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large\nmargin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.*",
      "*With the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves\nbetter performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on\ncorrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a\npretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive\npretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all\npermutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive",
      "- The specific attention pattern can be controlled at training and test time using the `perm_mask` input.\n- Due to the difficulty of training a fully auto-regressive model over various factorization order, XLNet is pretrained\n  using only a sub-set of the output tokens as target which are selected with the `target_mapping` input.\n- To use XLNet for sequential decoding (i.e. not in fully bi-directional setting), use the `perm_mask` and\n  `target_mapping` inputs to control the attention span and outputs (see examples in\n  *examples/pytorch/text-generation/run_generation.py*)\n- XLNet is one of the few models that has no sequence length limit.",

With Stable Diffusion, your application is usually restricted to one (or a few) different output resolutions, such as 512x512, or 256x256. Thus, it makes a lot of sense to unlock significant acceleration by reshaping the pipeline to a fixed resolution.

The conditions can be summarized as follows:",
      "-   The transformer-based encoder defines a mapping from the input\n    sequence \\\\(\\mathbf{X}_{1:n}\\\\) to a contextualized encoding sequence\n    \\\\(\\mathbf{\\overline{X}}_{1:n}\\\\).\n-   The transformer-based decoder defines the conditional distribution\n    \\\\(p_{\\theta_{\\text{dec}}}(\\mathbf{y}_i | \\mathbf{Y}_{0: i-1}, \\mathbf{\\overline{X}}_{1:n})\\\\).\n-   Given an appropriate decoding mechanism, the output sequence",

      "## Loading a Model\n\nLoading a model from the Hub is as simple as calling `timm.create_model` with the `pretrained` argument set to the name of the model you want to load. In this case, we'll use [`nateraw/resnet18-random`](https://huggingface.co/nateraw/resnet18-random), which is the model we just pushed to the Hub.\n\n```py\n>>> model_reloaded = timm.create_model('hf_hub:nateraw/resnet18-random', pretrained=True)\n```",

In this video we\u2019ll take a look at Masked Language Modeling.\nMasked language modeling is the task of predicting which words should fill in the blanks of a sentence.\nThese models take a masked text as the input and output the possible values for that mask.\nMasked language modeling is handy before fine-tuning your model for your task. For example, if you need to use a model in a specific domain, say, biomedical documents, models like BERT will treat your domain-specific words as rare tokens. If you train a masked language model using your biomedical corpus and then fine tune your model on a downstream task, you will have a better performance.\nClassification metrics can\u2019t be used as there\u2019s no single correct answer to mask values.

      ". Thus, to train a new tokenizer it is first necessary to build a training corpus composed of raw texts. Then, you have to choose an architecture for your tokenizer. Here there are two options: the simplest is to reuse the same architecture as the one of a tokenizer used by another model already trained,otherwise it is also possible to completely design your tokenizer but it requires more experience and attention. Once the architecture is chosen, one can thus train this tokenizer on your constituted corpus. Finally, the last thing that you need to do is to save the learned rules to be able to use this tokenizer which is now ready to be used. Let's take an example: let's say you want to train a GPT-2 model on Python code",

Now that we have our iterator on our python functions corpus, we can load the gpt-2 tokenizer architecture. Here \"old_tokenizer\" is not adapted to our corpus but we only need one more line to train it on our new corpus. An argument that is common to most of the tokenization algorithms used at the moment is the size of the vocabulary, we choose here the value 52 thousand. Finally, once the training is finished, we just have to save our new tokenizer locally or send it to the hub to be able to reuse it very easily afterwards",

We evaluate Kosmos-2 on a wide range of tasks, including (i) multimodal grounding, such as referring expression comprehension, and phrase grounding, (ii) multimodal referring, such as referring expression generation, (iii) perception-language tasks, and (iv) language understanding and generation.

      "### 7. What is pre-tokenization for a subword tokenizer?",
      "Subword tokenization allows the model to have a reasonable vocabulary size while being able to learn meaningful\ncontext-independent representations. In addition, subword tokenization enables the model to process words it has never\nseen before, by decomposing them into known subwords. For instance, the [`~transformers.BertTokenizer`] tokenizes\n`\"I have a new GPU!\"` as follows:\n\n```py\n>>> from transformers import BertTokenizer\n\n>>> tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n>>> tokenizer.tokenize(\"I have a new GPU!\")\n[\"i\", \"have\", \"a\", \"new\", \"gp\", \"##u\", \"!\"]\n```",
      "</Tip>\n\nWe could train our tokenizer right now, but it wouldn't be optimal.\nWithout a pre-tokenizer that will split our inputs into words, we might\nget tokens that overlap several words: for instance we could get an\n`\"it is\"` token since those two words\noften appear next to each other. Using a pre-tokenizer will ensure no\ntoken is bigger than a word returned by the pre-tokenizer. Here we want\nto train a subword BPE tokenizer, and we will use the easiest\npre-tokenizer possible by splitting on whitespace.",
      "Of course, if you change the way a tokenizer applies normalization, you\nshould probably retrain it from scratch afterward.\n\n## Pre-Tokenization\n\nPre-tokenization is the act of splitting a text into smaller objects\nthat give an upper bound to what your tokens will be at the end of\ntraining. A good way to think of this is that the pre-tokenizer will\nsplit your text into \"words\" and then, your final tokens will be parts\nof those words.\n\nAn easy way to pre-tokenize inputs is to split on spaces and\npunctuations, which is done by the\n`pre_tokenizers.Whitespace`\npre-tokenizer:",
      "The pre-tokenizer is just splitting on whitespace and punctuation:",
      "Since we're using a BERT tokenizer, the pre-tokenization involves splitting on whitespace and punctuation. Other tokenizers can have different rules for this step. For example, if we use the GPT-2 tokenizer:\n\n```py\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")\ntokenizer.backend_tokenizer.pre_tokenizer.pre_tokenize_str(\"Hello, how are  you?\")\n```\n\nit will split on whitespace and punctuation as well, but it will keep the spaces and replace them with a `\u0120` symbol, enabling it to recover the original spaces if we decode the tokens:",
      ". Finally, the \"backend_tokenizer\" of the fast tokenizers also allows to test the pre-tokenization operation very easily thanks to its \"pre_tokenize_str\" method. We notice that the output of this operation is composed of both tokens and offsets which allow to link the token to its position in the text given in input of the method. This operation defines the largest tokens that can be produced by the tokenization or in other words the barriers of the sub-tokens which will be produced then."

Finally, we show that the image generation computation in our method can be made highly efficient by reparameterization. With traditional AR methods, the text-to-image generation time increases linearly with the output image resolution and hence is quite time consuming even for normal size images. The VQ-Diffusion allows us to achieve a better trade-off between quality and speed. Our experiments indicate that the VQ-Diffusion model with the reparameterization is fifteen times faster than traditional AR methods while achieving a better image quality.*",
      "Despite having made tremendous strides, AR models still suffer from linear decreases in inference speed for increased image resolution, error accumulation, and directional bias. For equivalently sized AR transformer models, the big-O of VQ-Diffusion's inference is better so long as the number of diffusion steps is less than the number of latent pixels. For the ITHQ dataset, the latent resolution is 32x32 and the model is trained up to 100 diffusion steps for an ~10x big-O improvement. In practice, VQ-Diffusion \"can be 15 times faster than AR methods while achieving a better image quality\" (see [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14822) for more details)",
      "VQ-Diffusion also supports a faster inference strategy. The network reparameterization relies on the posterior of the diffusion process conditioned on the un-noised image being tractable. A similar formula applies when using a time stride, \\\\( \\Delta t \\\\), that skips a number of reverse diffusion steps, \\\\( p_\\theta (x_{t - \\Delta t } | x_t, y) = \\sum_{\\tilde{x}_0=1}^{K}{q(x_{t - \\Delta t} | x_t, \\tilde{x}_0)} p_\\theta(\\tilde{x}_0 | x_t, y) \\\\).",

And whether you write your own model from scratch or load a pre-trained one, you interact with the model in the same way - through the same few methods you're going to see again and again, like *fit*, *compile* and *predict,* and we'll cover concrete examples of how to use those methods in other videos that I'll link below",

As a part of \ud83e\udd17 Transformers core philosophy to make the library easy, simple and flexible to use, an `AutoClass` automatically infers and loads the correct architecture from a given checkpoint. The `from_pretrained()` method lets you quickly load a pretrained model for any architecture so you don't have to devote time and resources to train a model from scratch.

OWL-ViT is an open-vocabulary object detection network trained on a variety of (image, text) pairs. It can be used to query an image with one or multiple text queries to search for and detect target objects described in text.",
      "**The area under the Precision x Recall curve (AUC) computed for a target class represents the Average Precision value for that particular class.** The COCO evaluation approach refers to \"AP\" as the mean AUC value among all target classes in the image dataset, also referred to as Mean Average Precision (mAP) by other approaches.\n\nFor a large dataset, the detector will likely output boxes with a wide range of confidence levels, resulting in a jagged Precision x Recall line, making it challenging to compute its AUC (Average Precision) precisely. Different methods approximate the area of the curve with different approaches. A popular approach is called N-interpolation, where N represents how many points are sampled from the Precision x Recall blue line.",
      "* **AP@.5**: sets IoU threshold = 0.5 and computes the Precision x Recall AUC for each target class in the image dataset. Then, the computed results for each class are summed up and divided by the number of classes.\n* **AP@.75**: uses the same methodology as AP@.50, with IoU threshold = 0.75. With this higher IoU requirement, AP@.75 is considered stricter than AP@.5 and should be used to evaluate models that need to achieve a high level of localization accuracy in their detections.",

In particular, we might update the API or behavior of such features without any deprecation\ncycle. A warning message is triggered when using an experimental feature to warn you about it. If you're comfortable debugging any potential issues using an experimental feature, you can set `HF_HUB_DISABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_WARNING=1` to disable the warning.\n\nIf you are using an experimental feature, please let us know!

Consequently, `hf_transfer` is not enabled by default in `huggingface_hub`.\n\n## Deprecated environment variables\n\nIn order to standardize all environment variables within the Hugging Face ecosystem, some variables have been marked as deprecated.

      "To get the biggest improvement in latency, the assistant model should be significantly faster than the main model, \nwhile predicting the same token distribution as often as possible. In practice, these two attributes form a trade-off:\nthe faster a model is, the less accurate it is. However, since 70-80% of all predicted tokens tend to be \"easier\" tokens,\nthis trade-off is heavily biased towards selecting a faster model, rather than a more accurate one. Thus, the assistant \nmodel should be at least 3x faster than the main model (the more the better), while predicting all the \"easy\" tokens \nin the examples correctly. The remaining 20-30% of more \"difficult\" tokens can then be verified by the larger, main model.",

In other words, all the samples will be generated 17 times faster.",
      "First, the requirement \u2013 the assistant must have the exact same tokenizer as your model. If this requirement was not in place, expensive token decoding and re-encoding steps would have to be added. Furthermore, these additional steps would have to happen on the CPU, which in turn may need slow inter-device data transfers. Fast usage of the assistant is critical for the benefits of assisted generation to show up.",
      "While these candidate tokens are generated quickly, they may differ from those predicted by the main model. Therefore, \nin the second step, the candidate tokens are passed to the main model to be \"verified\". The main model takes the \ncandidate tokens as input and performs a **single forward pass**. The outputs of the main model are the \"correct\" \ntoken for each step in the token sequence \\\\( \\boldsymbol{y}_{1:N} \\\\).",

A complete guide to Whisper fine-tuning can be found \n[here](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-whisper), and distillation [here](https://github.com/huggingface/distil-whisper/tree/main/training).",
      "Finally, the heuristic. By this point, you have probably noticed the similarities between the movie Inception and assisted generation \u2013 you are, after all, running text generation inside text generation. There will be one assistant model forward pass per candidate token, and we know that forward passes are expensive. While you can\u2019t know in advance the number of tokens that the assistant model will get right, you can keep track of this information and use it to limit the number of candidate tokens requested to the assistant \u2013 some sections of the output are easier to anticipate than others.",
      "Let\u2019s consider for a second that you have access to a magical latency-free oracle model that generates the same sequence as your model, for any given input. For argument\u2019s sake, it can\u2019t be used directly, it\u2019s limited to being an assistant to your generation procedure. Using the property described above, you could use this assistant model to get candidate output tokens followed by a forward pass with your model to confirm that they are indeed correct. In this utopian scenario, the latency of text generation would be reduced from `O(n)` to `O(1)`, with `n` being the number of generated tokens. For long generations, we're talking about several orders of magnitude."

For many tasks\nand small output sizes this works well. However, when used to generate longer outputs, greedy search can start\nproducing highly repetitive results.\n\n## Customize text generation\n\nYou can override any `generation_config` by passing the parameters and their values directly to the [`generate`] method:\n\n```python\n>>> my_model.generate(**inputs, num_beams=4, do_sample=True)  # doctest: +SKIP\n```",

To learn more, check [`StoppingCriteria`].\n- `num_beams`: by specifying a number of beams higher than 1, you are effectively switching from greedy search to\nbeam search.

      "If training on TPU, it is recommended to pad all examples of the dataset to the same length or make use of\n*pad_to_multiple_of* to have a small number of predefined bucket sizes to fit all examples in. Dynamically padding\nbatches to the longest example is not recommended on TPU as it triggers a recompilation for every batch shape that is\nencountered during training thus significantly slowing down the training. only padding up to the longest example in a\nbatch) leads to very slow training on TPU.\n\n## Inference",
      "There\u2019s also another important reason to care about TPU training right now: Recent major advances in LLMs and generative AI have created huge public interest in model training, and so it\u2019s become incredibly hard for most people to get access to state-of-the-art GPUs. Knowing how to train on TPU gives you another path to access ultra-high-performance compute hardware, which is much more dignified than losing a bidding war for the last H100 on eBay and then ugly crying at your desk. You deserve better. And speaking from experience: Once you get comfortable with training on TPU, you might not want to go back.\n\n## What to expect",
      "<Tip>\n\n**\ud83e\udd17Specific HuggingFace Tip\ud83e\udd17:** Our tokenizers and data collators have methods that can help you here. You can use `padding=\"max_length\"` or `padding=\"longest\"` when calling tokenizers to get them to output padded data. Our tokenizers and data collators also have a `pad_to_multiple_of` argument that you can use to reduce the number of unique input shapes you see!\n\n</Tip>\n\n### How do I actually train my model on TPU?",
      "## Conclusion\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing we want to emphasize with this example, it\u2019s that TPU training is **powerful, scalable and easy.** In fact, if you\u2019re already using Transformers models with TF/Keras and streaming data from `tf.data`, you might be shocked at how little work it takes to move your whole training pipeline to TPU. They have a reputation as somewhat arcane, high-end, complex hardware, but they\u2019re quite approachable, and instantiating a large pod slice is definitely easier than keeping multiple GPU servers in sync!\n\nDiversifying the hardware that state-of-the-art models are trained on is going to be critical in the 2020s, especially if the ongoing GPU shortage continues. We hope that this guide will give you the tools you need to power cutting-edge training runs no matter what circumstances you face.",
      ". We can confirm this by asking the Trainer to get us a batch of the training data loader, which reproduces the same error. Either by inspecting the inputs or debugging, we can then see they are not all of the same size. This is because we have not passed a data collator to do the padding in the Trainer and didn't pad when preprocessing the data either. Padding inside the Trainer is normally the default, but only if you provide your tokenizer to the Trainer, and we forgot to do that. So let's fix the issue and run again. This time we get a nasty CUDA error",
      "### Multi-GPU and TPU usage\n\nBy default, the script uses a `MirroredStrategy` and will use multiple GPUs effectively if they are available. TPUs\ncan also be used by passing the name of the TPU resource with the `--tpu` argument. There are some issues surrounding\nthese strategies and our models right now, which are most likely to appear in the evaluation/prediction steps. We're\nactively working on better support for multi-GPU and TPU training in TF, but if you encounter problems a quick \nworkaround is to train in the multi-GPU or TPU context and then perform predictions outside of it.\n\n### Memory usage and data loading",
      "#### TPU Training\n`Seq2SeqTrainer` supports TPU training with few caveats\n1. As `generate` method does not work on TPU at the moment, `predict_with_generate` cannot be used. You should use `--prediction_loss_only` to only calculate loss, and do not set `--do_predict` and `--predict_with_generate`.\n2. All sequences should be padded to be of equal length to avoid extremely slow training. (`finetune_trainer.py` does this automatically when running on TPU.)"

      "### What is GPTQ?\n\nGPTQ is a post-training quantziation method to compress LLMs, like GPT. GPTQ compresses GPT (decoder) models by reducing the number of bits needed to store each weight in the model, from 32 bits down to just 3-4 bits. This means the model takes up much less memory and can run on less Hardware, e.g. Single GPU for 13B Llama2 models. GPTQ analyzes each layer of the model separately and approximates the weights to preserve the overall accuracy.

      "[T5](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore/t5-small-ipu) (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a revolutionary new model that can take any text and convert it into a machine learning format for translation, question answering or classification. It introduces a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format for transfer learning. By doing so, it has simplified a way to use the same model, objective function, hyperparameters, and decoding procedure across a diverse set of NLP tasks.\n\n### Speech",

Share a `timm` model on the Hub\n  2. How to load that model back from the Hub\n\n## Authenticating\n\nFirst, you'll need to make sure you have the `huggingface_hub` package installed.\n\n```bash\npip install huggingface_hub\n```\n\nThen, you'll need to authenticate yourself.

    "generated_answer": "The GPT-2 tokenizer treats spaces as part of the token and replaces them with a `\u0120` symbol. (Source: Document 1)",
    "retrieved_docs": [
      "This tokenizer has a few special symbols, like `\u0120` and `\u010a`, which denote spaces and newlines, respectively. As we can see, this is not too efficient: the tokenizer returns individual tokens for each space, when it could group together indentation levels (since having sets of four or eight spaces is going to be very common in code). It also split the function name a bit weirdly, not being used to seeing words with the `_` character.\n\nLet's train a new tokenizer and see if it solves those issues. For this, we'll use the method `train_new_from_iterator()`:\n\n```py\ntokenizer = old_tokenizer.train_new_from_iterator(training_corpus, 52000)\n```",
      "Like the GPT-2 tokenizer, this one keeps spaces and replaces them with a specific token (`_`), but the T5 tokenizer only splits on whitespace, not punctuation. Also note that it added a space by default at the beginning of the sentence (before `Hello`) and ignored the double space between `are` and `you`.\n\nNow that we've seen a little of how some different tokenizers process text, we can start to explore the underlying algorithms themselves. We'll begin with a quick look at the broadly widely applicable SentencePiece; then, over the next three sections, we'll examine how the three main algorithms used for subword tokenization work.\n\n## SentencePiece[[sentencepiece]]",
      ". Finally, let's see together on an example if it was useful to re-train a tokenizer similar to gpt2 one. With the original tokenizer of GPT-2 we see that all spaces are isolated and the method name \"randn\" relatively common in python code is split in 2. With our new tokenizer, single and double indentations have been learned and the method \"randn\" is tokenized into 1 token. And with that, you now know how to train your very own tokenizers!",
      "-->\n\n# Tokenizer\n\nA tokenizer is in charge of preparing the inputs for a model. The library contains tokenizers for all the models. Most\nof the tokenizers are available in two flavors: a full python implementation and a \"Fast\" implementation based on the\nRust library [\ud83e\udd17 Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers). The \"Fast\" implementations allows:\n\n1. a significant speed-up in particular when doing batched tokenization and\n2. additional methods to map between the original string (character and words) and the token space (e.g. getting the\n   index of the token comprising a given character or the span of characters corresponding to a given token).",
      "<Youtube id=\"ssLq_EK2jLE\"/>\n\nCharacter-based tokenizers split the text into characters, rather than words. This has two primary benefits:\n\n- The vocabulary is much smaller.\n- There are much fewer out-of-vocabulary (unknown) tokens, since every word can be built from characters.\n\nBut here too some questions arise concerning spaces and punctuation:",
      ". We also notice that spaces have been replaced by a capital G with a dot above. Albert's pre-tokenization divides the text at the level of spaces, adds a space at the beginning of the sentence and replaces spaces with a special underscore. Finally, Bert's pre-tokenization divides the text at the level of punctuation and spaces. Unlike the previous tokenizers, spaces are not transformed and integrated to the tokens produced with this pre-tokenizer. Through these 3 examples, we could observe the two main types of operations brought by the pre-tokenization: some changes on the text and the division of the string into tokens that can be associated to words",
      "Since we're using a BERT tokenizer, the pre-tokenization involves splitting on whitespace and punctuation. Other tokenizers can have different rules for this step. For example, if we use the GPT-2 tokenizer:\n\n```py\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")\ntokenizer.backend_tokenizer.pre_tokenizer.pre_tokenize_str(\"Hello, how are  you?\")\n```\n\nit will split on whitespace and punctuation as well, but it will keep the spaces and replace them with a `\u0120` symbol, enabling it to recover the original spaces if we decode the tokens:"

You also learned\nhow Vertex AI\u2019s features benefit the model deployment process by enabling\nyou to focus on declarative configurations and removing the complex\nparts. Vertex AI also supports deployment of PyTorch models via custom\nprediction routes.

      "his notebook shows how to deploy a vision model from \ud83e\udd17 Transformers (written in TensorFlow) to [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). This is beneficial in many ways:\n\n* Vertex AI provides support for autoscaling, authorization, and authentication out of the box.\n* One can maintain multiple versions of a model and can control the traffic split very easily. \n* Purely serverless. \n\nThis notebook uses code from [this official GCP example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/community/vertex_endpoints/optimized_tensorflow_runtime/bert_optimized_online_prediction.ipynb).\n\nThis tutorial uses the following billable components of Google Cloud:",

It is divided into four steps:\n\n1. uploading a model\n2. creating an endpoint \n3. deploying the model to the endpoint\n4. making prediction requests. \n\nThroughout these steps, you will\nneed `ModelServiceClient`, `EndpointServiceClient`, and\n`PredictionServiceClient` modules from the `google-cloud-aiplatform`\nPython SDK to interact with Vertex AI.\n\n![](./assets/97_vertex_ai/image3.png)"

Furthermore, we use reversible residual\nlayers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of\nN times, where N is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models\nwhile being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.*",
      "However, there's an important limitation to the architecture of the Transformer: due to its [self-attention mechanism](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/), it scales [very poorly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06732v2) in both compute and memory. In every layer, all inputs are used to produce queries and keys, for which a pairwise dot product is computed. Hence, it is not possible to apply self-attention on high-dimensional data without some form of preprocessing. Wav2Vec2, for example, solves this by employing a feature encoder to turn a raw waveform into a sequence of time-based features",
      "Using Local self attention, the memory and time complexity of the query-key matmul operation can be reduced from\n\\\\(\\mathcal{O}(n_s \\times n_s)\\\\) to \\\\(\\mathcal{O}(n_s \\times \\log(n_s))\\\\), which usually represents the memory\nand time bottleneck in a transformer model, with \\\\(n_s\\\\) being the sequence length.\n\n\n### Training",
      "Important to remember is that for each output vector \\\\(\\mathbf{z}_{i}\\\\), the whole input sequence \\\\(\\mathbf{X}\\\\) is processed. The tensor of the inner dot-product \\\\(\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{K}^T\\\\) has an asymptotic memory complexity of \\\\(\\mathcal{O}(n^2)\\\\) which usually represents the memory bottleneck in a transformer model. \n\nThis is also the reason why `bert-base-cased` has a `config.max_position_embedding_size` of only 512.\n\n### Local Self-Attention",
      "# Understanding BigBird's Block Sparse Attention\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nTransformer-based models have shown to be very useful for many NLP tasks. However, a major limitation of transformers-based models is its \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\) time & memory complexity (where \\\\(n\\\\) is sequence length). Hence, it's computationally very expensive to apply transformer-based models on long sequences \\\\(n > 512\\\\). Several recent papers, *e.g.* `Longformer`, `Performer`, `Reformer`, `Clustered attention` try to remedy this problem by approximating the full attention matrix. You can checkout \ud83e\udd17's recent blog [post](https://huggingface.co/blog/long-range-transformers) in case you are unfamiliar with these models.",
      "1. **Quadratic computation of canonical self-attention:** The vanilla Transformer has a computational complexity of \\\\(O(T^2 D)\\\\) where \\\\(T\\\\) is the time series length and \\\\(D\\\\) is the dimension of the hidden states. For long sequence time-series forecasting (also known as the _LSTF problem_), this might be really computationally expensive. To solve this problem, Informer employs a new self-attention mechanism called _ProbSparse_ attention, which has \\\\(O(T \\log T)\\\\) time and space complexity.",
      "## Introduction\n\nTransformers have exhibited remarkable performance on various Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision tasks.

However, the standard self-attention mechanism has a time and memory complexity of \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\) (where \\\\(n\\\\) is the length of the input sequence), making it expensive to train on long input sequences."

      "<Tip warning={true}>\n\nIf you are used to working with platforms such as GitLab/GitHub/Bitbucket, your first instinct\nmight be to use `git` CLI to clone your repo (`git clone`), commit changes (`git add, git commit`) and push them\n(`git push`). This is valid when using the Hugging Face Hub. However, software engineering and machine learning do\nnot share the same requirements and workflows. Model repositories might maintain large model weight files for different\nframeworks and tools, so cloning the repository can lead to you maintaining large local folders with massive sizes. As\na result, it may be more efficient to use our custom HTTP methods. You can read our [Git vs HTTP paradigm](../concepts/git_vs_http)\nexplanation page for more details.",
      "In addition to the functionalities already provided by `git`, the [`HfApi`] class offers\nadditional features, such as the ability to manage repos, download files using caching for\nefficient reuse, search the Hub for repos and metadata, access community features such as\ndiscussions, PRs, and comments, and configure Spaces hardware and secrets.\n\n## What should I use ? And when ?\n\nOverall, the **HTTP-based approach is the recommended way to use** `huggingface_hub`\nin all cases. [`HfApi`] allows to pull and push changes, work with PRs, tags and branches, interact with discussions and much more. Since the `0.16` release, the http-based methods can also run in the background, which was the last major advantage of the [`Repository`] class.",
      "The first approach, the so-called \"git-based\" approach, is led by the [`Repository`] class.\nThis method uses a wrapper around the `git` command with additional functions specifically\ndesigned to interact with the Hub. The second option, called the \"HTTP-based\" approach,\ninvolves making HTTP requests using the [`HfApi`] client. Let's examine the pros and cons\nof each approach.\n\n## Repository: the historical git-based approach\n\nAt first, `huggingface_hub` was mostly built around the [`Repository`] class. It provides\nPython wrappers for common `git` commands such as `\"git add\"`, `\"git commit\"`, `\"git push\"`,\n`\"git tag\"`, `\"git checkout\"`, etc.",

There are two main\nways to access the Hub using `huggingface_hub`.",
      "## Submitting a pull request (PR)\n\nBefore writing code, we strongly advise you to search through the existing PRs or\nissues to make sure that nobody is already working on the same thing. If you are\nunsure, it is always a good idea to open an issue to get some feedback.\n\nYou will need basic `git` proficiency to be able to contribute to\n`huggingface_hub`. `git` is not the easiest tool to use but it has the greatest\nmanual. Type `git --help` in a shell and enjoy. If you prefer books, [Pro\nGit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a very good reference.\n\nFollow these steps to start contributing:",
      "No changes to highlight.\n\n### Breaking Changes:\n\n- `gr.HuggingFaceDatasetSaver` behavior changed internally. The `flagging/` folder is not a `.git/` folder anymore when using it. `organization` parameter is now ignored in favor of passing a full dataset id as `dataset_name` (e.g. `\"username/my-dataset\"`).\n- New lines (`\\n`) are not automatically converted to `<br>` in `gr.Markdown()` or `gr.Chatbot()`. For multiple new lines, a developer must add multiple `<br>` tags.\n\n### Full Changelog:"

      "### Summarization\n\nSummarization creates a shorter version of a text from a longer one while trying to preserve most of the meaning of the original document. Summarization is a sequence-to-sequence task; it outputs a shorter text sequence than the input. There are a lot of long-form documents that can be summarized to help readers quickly understand the main points. Legislative bills, legal and financial documents, patents, and scientific papers are a few examples of documents that could be summarized to save readers time and serve as a reading aid.\n\nLike question answering, there are two types of summarization:\n\n* extractive: identify and extract the most important sentences from the original text\n* abstractive: generate the target summary (which may include new words not in the input document) from the original text; the [`SummarizationPipeline`] uses the abstractive approach",

      "## Guess mode\n\n[Guess mode](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet/discussions/188) does not require supplying a prompt to a ControlNet at all! This forces the ControlNet encoder to do it's best to \"guess\" the contents of the input control map (depth map, pose estimation, canny edge, etc.).\n\nGuess mode adjusts the scale of the output residuals from a ControlNet by a fixed ratio depending on the block depth. The shallowest `DownBlock` corresponds to 0.1, and as the blocks get deeper, the scale increases exponentially such that the scale of the `MidBlock` output becomes 1.0.\n\n<Tip>\n\nGuess mode does not have any impact on prompt conditioning and you can still provide a prompt if you want.",
      "Besides `num_inference_steps`, we've been using another function argument, called `guidance_scale` in all \nprevious examples. `guidance_scale` is a way to increase the adherence to the conditional signal that guides the generation (text, in this case) as well as overall sample quality. \nIt is also known as [classifier-free guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598), which in simple terms forces the generation to better match the prompt potentially at the cost of image quality or diversity. \nValues between `7` and `8.5` are usually good choices for Stable Diffusion.  By default the pipeline\nuses a `guidance_scale` of 7.5.",
      "The `guidance_scale` is used in classifier free guidance (CFG), setting the weighting between the conditional logits\n(which are predicted from the text prompts) and the unconditional logits (which are predicted from an unconditional or\n'null' prompt). Higher guidance scale encourages the model to generate samples that are more closely linked to the input\nprompt, usually at the expense of poorer audio quality. CFG is enabled by setting `guidance_scale > 1`. For best results,\nuse `guidance_scale=3` (default).\n\n### Audio-Prompted Generation\n\nThe same [`MusicgenProcessor`] can be used to pre-process an audio prompt that is used for audio continuation. In the\nfollowing example, we load an audio file using the \ud83e\udd17 Datasets library, which can be pip installed through the command\nbelow:",
      "### Guidance scale\n\nThe `guidance_scale` parameter is used to control how closely aligned the generated image and text prompt are. A higher `guidance_scale` value means your generated image is more aligned with the prompt, while a lower `guidance_scale` value means your generated image has more space to deviate from the prompt.\n\nYou can combine `guidance_scale` with `strength` for even more precise control over how expressive the model is. For example, combine a high `strength + guidance_scale` for maximum creativity or use a combination of low `strength` and low `guidance_scale` to generate an image that resembles the initial image but is not as strictly bound to the prompt.\n\n```py\nimport torch\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForImage2Image\nfrom diffusers.utils import make_image_grid, load_image",
      "Some details to keep in mind:\n\n* To perform classifier-free guidance, batch size is usually doubled inside the pipeline. LCM, however, applies guidance using guidance embeddings, so the batch size does not have to be doubled in this case. This leads to a faster inference time, with the drawback that negative prompts don't have any effect on the denoising process.\n* The UNet was trained using the [3., 13.] guidance scale range. So, that is the ideal range for `guidance_scale`. However, disabling `guidance_scale` using a value of 1.0 is also effective in most cases.\n\n\n## Image-to-image",
      "### Guidance scale\n\n`guidance_scale` affects how aligned the text prompt and generated image are.\n\n* \ud83d\udcc8 a high `guidance_scale` value means the prompt and generated image are closely aligned, so the output is a stricter interpretation of the prompt\n* \ud83d\udcc9 a low `guidance_scale` value means the prompt and generated image are more loosely aligned, so the output may be more varied from the prompt\n\nYou can use `strength` and `guidance_scale` together for more control over how expressive the model is.

This model can detect 217 languages which will likely represent the majority of languages for datasets hosted on the Hub. \n\nWe pass 20 examples to the model representing rows from a dataset. This results in 20 individual language predictions (one per row) for each dataset.",
      "4. Sometimes, the dataset will have a column specifying the language of the text. You can use this column to fill in the language tag(s).\n   5. If the dataset viewer is available for the dataset, but you don't recognize the language, you can use the [facebook/fasttext-language-identification](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification) model or [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) to try to identify the language.",
      "To speed up computation, fastText uses hierarchical softmax, capitalizing on the imbalanced distribution of classes. All these techniques offer users scalable solutions for text representation and classification.\n\nHugging Face is now hosting official mirrors of word vectors of all 157 languages and the latest model for language identification. This means that using Hugging Face, you can easily download and use the models with a few commands. \n\n### Finding models\n\nWord vectors for 157 languages and the language identification model can be found in the [Meta AI](https://huggingface.co/facebook) org. For example, you can find the model page for English word vectors [here](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-en-vectors) and the language identification model [here](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification).",
      "Here is how to use this model to detect the language of a given text:\n\n```python\n>>> import fasttext\n>>> from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\n\n>>> model_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id=\"facebook/fasttext-language-identification\", filename=\"model.bin\")\n>>> model = fasttext.load_model(model_path)\n>>> model.predict(\"Hello, world!\")\n\n(('__label__eng_Latn',), array([0.81148803]))\n\n>>> model.predict(\"Hello, world!\", k=5)",
      "### Using Librarian-Bot to Update Metadata\n\nTo ensure this valuable language metadata is incorporated back into the Hub, we turn to Librarian-Bot! Librarian-Bot takes the language predictions generated by Meta's [facebook/fasttext-language-identification](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification) fastText model and opens pull requests to add this information to the metadata of each respective dataset. \n\nThis automated system not only updates the datasets with language information, but also does it swiftly and efficiently, without requiring manual work from humans. Once these pull requests are approved and merged, the language metadata becomes available for all users, significantly enhancing the usability of the Hugging Face Hub. You can keep track of what the librarian-bot is doing [here](https://huggingface.co/librarian-bot/activity/community)!",

Discover pre-trained models and datasets for your projects or play with the thousands of machine learning apps hosted on the Hub. You can also create and share your own models, datasets and demos with the community. The `huggingface_hub` library provides a simple way to do all these things with Python.\n\n## Key features",

As mentioned earlier, we not only support models from \ud83e\udd17 Transformers on the Hub but also models from other third-party libraries. To this end, we provide [several utilities](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-adding-libraries) so that you can integrate your own library with the Hub. One of the primary advantages of doing this is that it becomes very easy to share artifacts (such as models and datasets) with the community, thereby making it easier for your users to try out your models.",

In this video we will explore how to do that. The downloading part is easy: with the load_dataset function, you can directly download and cache a dataset from its identifier on the Dataset hub. Here we fetch the MRPC dataset from the GLUE benchmark, which is a dataset containing pairs of sentences where the task is to determine the paraphrases. The object returned by the load_dataset function is a DatasetDict, which is a sort of dictionary containing each split of our dataset. We can access each split by indexing with its name",

This includes creating new repositories, uploading data programmatically and creating and modifying metadata for datasets. This can be powerful for research workflows where new data or annotations continue to be created. The client library also makes uploading large datasets much more accessible. \n\n## Community",

In PyTorch, the default value of `return_tensors` is `\"pt\"`, so you can often omit this argument. However, in TensorFlow, the default value is not specified, and you should set it to `\"tf\"` to get the correct tensors.\n\nAdditionally, when using the `Dataset.map` function with PyArrow, returning tensors as NumPy arrays (`return_tensors=\"np\"`) can be faster than converting them to a PyArrow-supported format.\n\nSource:\n- Document 0: The `tokenizer` object can handle the conversion to specific framework tensors...\n- Document 2: Note that all of our collators take a return_tensors argument...",
    "retrieved_docs": [
      "The `tokenizer` object can handle the conversion to specific framework tensors, which can then be directly sent to the model. For example, in the following code sample we are prompting the tokenizer to return tensors from the different frameworks \u2014 `\"pt\"` returns PyTorch tensors, `\"tf\"` returns TensorFlow tensors, and `\"np\"` returns NumPy arrays:\n\n```py\nsequences = [\"I've been waiting for a HuggingFace course my whole life.\", \"So have I!\"]\n\n# Returns PyTorch tensors\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer(sequences, padding=True, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\n# Returns TensorFlow tensors\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer(sequences, padding=True, return_tensors=\"tf\")",
      "<Tip>\n\nCheck out the [Padding and truncation](./pad_truncation) concept guide to learn more different padding and truncation arguments.\n\n</Tip>\n\n### Build tensors\n\nFinally, you want the tokenizer to return the actual tensors that get fed to the model.\n\nSet the `return_tensors` parameter to either `pt` for PyTorch, or `tf` for TensorFlow:\n\n<frameworkcontent>\n<pt>",
      ". Note that all of our collators take a return_tensors argument - you can set this to \"pt\" to get PyTorch Tensors, \"tf\" to get TensorFlow Tensors, or \"np\" to get Numpy arrays. For backward compatibility reasons, the default value is \"pt\", so PyTorch users don't even have to set this argument most of the time, and so are often totally unaware that this option exists. This is a valuable lesson about how the beneficiaries of privilege are often the most blind to its existence. So now let's see some specific DataCollators in action, though remember that if none of them do what you need, you can always write your own! First, we'll see the \"basic\" data collators",
      "The [`~Dataset.map`] function converts the returned values to a PyArrow-supported format.

    "true_answer": "FileExplorer",
    "source_doc": "gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/js/fileexplorer/CHANGELOG.md",
    "generated_answer": "The Gradio component used for file uploads is called `UploadButton`. It is a button form file upload component that can accept specific file types. Additionally, there are other components like `File` and `PDF` that can also be used for file uploads.\n\n**Source:** Document 0 and Document 2",
    "retrieved_docs": [
      "###### Upload Button\n\nThere is now a new component called the `UploadButton` which is a file upload component but in button form! You can also specify what file types it should accept in the form of a list (ex: `image`, `video`, `audio`, `text`, or generic `file`). Added by [@dawoodkhan82](https://github.com/dawoodkhan82) in [PR 2591](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2591).\n\nExample of how it can be used:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef upload_file(files):\n    file_paths = [file.name for file in files]\n    return file_paths",
      "## Leveraging Existing Gradio Components\n\nMost of Gradio's frontend components are published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), the javascript package repository.\nThis means that you can use them to save yourself time while incorporating common patterns in your component, like uploading files.\nFor example, the `@gradio/upload` package has `Upload` and `ModifyUpload` components for properly uploading files to the Gradio server. \nHere is how you can use them to create a user interface to upload and display PDF files.",
      "Gradio Demo: uploadbutton_component\n\n\n```\n!pip install -q gradio \n```\n\n\n```\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef upload_file(files):\n    file_paths = [file.name for file in files]\n    return file_paths\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    file_output = gr.File()\n    upload_button = gr.UploadButton(\"Click to Upload an Image or Video File\", file_types=[\"image\", \"video\"], file_count=\"multiple\")\n    upload_button.upload(upload_file, upload_button, file_output)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```",
      "This will create a Gradio app which has an `Image` component as the input and the output. \nIn the frontend, the Image component will actually **upload** the file to the server and send the **filepath** but this is converted to a `numpy` array before it is sent to a user's function. \nConversely, when the user returns a `numpy` array from their function, the numpy array is converted to a file so that it can be sent to the frontend and displayed by the `Image` component.",
      "## Handling Files\n\nIf your component deals with files, these files **should** be uploaded to the backend server. \nThe `@gradio/client` npm package provides the `upload`, `prepare_files`, and `normalise_file` utility functions to help you do this.\n\nThe `prepare_files` function will convert the browser's `File` datatype to gradio's internal `FileData` type.\nYou should use the `FileData` data in your component to keep track of uploaded files.\n\nThe `upload` function will upload an array of `FileData` values to the server.\n\nThe `normalise_file` function will generate the correct URL for your component to fetch the file from and set it to the `data` property of the `FileData.`",
      "## Conclusion\n\nIn order to use our new component in **any** gradio 4.0 app, simply install it with pip, e.g. `pip install gradio-pdf`. Then you can use it like the built-in `gr.File()` component (except that it will only accept and display PDF files).\n\nHere is a simple demo with the Blocks api:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nfrom gradio_pdf import PDF\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    pdf = PDF(label=\"Upload a PDF\", interactive=True)\n    name = gr.Textbox()\n    pdf.upload(lambda f: f, pdf, name)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```",
      "* Gradio will automatically place the file in a cache so that duplicate copies of the file don't get saved.\n\n* The client libraries will automatically know that they should upload input files prior to sending the request. They will also automatically download files.\n\nIf you do not use the `FileData`, your component will not work as expected!\n\n\n## Adding Event Triggers To Your Component\n\nThe events triggers for your component are defined in the `EVENTS` class attribute.\nThis is a list that contains the string names of the events.\nAdding an event to this list will automatically add a method with that same name to your component!\n\nYou can import the `Events` enum from `gradio.events` to access commonly used events in the core gradio components."

To do this we use a *tokenizer*, which will be responsible for:\n\n- Splitting the input into words, subwords, or symbols (like punctuation) that are called *tokens*\n- Mapping each token to an integer\n- Adding additional inputs that may be useful to the model",
      "<Youtube id=\"grlLV8AIXug\"/>\n\nAs we will see in the next sections, a tokenizer cannot be trained on raw text alone. Instead, we first need to split the texts into small entities, like words. That's where the pre-tokenization step comes in. As we saw in [Chapter 2](/course/chapter2), a word-based tokenizer can simply split a raw text into words on whitespace and punctuation. Those words will be the boundaries of the subtokens the tokenizer can learn during its training.\n\nTo see how a fast tokenizer performs pre-tokenization, we can use the `pre_tokenize_str()` method of the `pre_tokenizer` attribute of the `tokenizer` object:",
      "<Youtube id=\"Yffk5aydLzg\"/>\n\nThe main tool for preprocessing textual data is a [tokenizer](main_classes/tokenizer). A tokenizer splits text into *tokens* according to a set of rules. The tokens are converted into numbers and then tensors, which become the model inputs. Any additional inputs required by the model are added by the tokenizer.\n\n<Tip>\n\nIf you plan on using a pretrained model, it's important to use the associated pretrained tokenizer. This ensures the text is split the same way as the pretraining corpus, and uses the same corresponding tokens-to-index (usually referred to as the *vocab*) during pretraining.\n\n</Tip>",
      "<Youtube id=\"VFp38yj8h3A\"/>\n\nAs we saw in [the preprocessing tutorial](preprocessing), tokenizing a text is splitting it into words or\nsubwords, which then are converted to ids through a look-up table. Converting words or subwords to ids is\nstraightforward, so in this summary, we will focus on splitting a text into words or subwords (i.e. tokenizing a text).\nMore specifically, we will look at the three main types of tokenizers used in \ud83e\udd17 Transformers: [Byte-Pair Encoding\n(BPE)](#byte-pair-encoding), [WordPiece](#wordpiece), and [SentencePiece](#sentencepiece), and show examples\nof which tokenizer type is used by which model.",
      "Before we dive more deeply into the three most common subword tokenization algorithms used with Transformer models (Byte-Pair Encoding [BPE], WordPiece, and Unigram), we'll first take a look at the preprocessing that each tokenizer applies to text. Here's a high-level overview of the steps in the tokenization pipeline:",
      ". The tokenization process has several steps. First, the text is split into small chunks called tokens. They can be words, parts of words or punctuation symbols. Then the tokenizer will had some special tokens (if the model expect them). Here the model uses expects a CLS token at the beginning and a SEP token at the end of the sentence to classify. Lastly, the tokenizer matches each token to its unique ID in the vocabulary of the pretrained model. To load such a tokenizer, the Transformers library provides the AutoTokenizer API. The most important method of this class is from_pretrained, which will download and cache the configuration and the vocabulary associated to a given checkpoint",
      ". The first step is to split our input text into tokens with the tokenize method. To do this, the tokenizer may first perform some operations like lowercasing all words, then follow a set of rules to split the result in small chunks of text. Most of the Transformers models use a subword tokenization algorithm, which means that one given word can be split in several tokens, like tokenize here. Look at the \"Tokenization algorithms\" videos linked below for more information! The ## prefix we see in front of ize is the convention used by BERT to indicate this token is not the beginning of a word. Other tokenizers may use different conventions however: for instance ALBERT tokenizers will add a long underscore in front of all the tokens that had a space before them, which is a convention used by sentencepiece tokenizers"

Below is the snapshot of the plots from wandb [run](https://wandb.ai/smangrul/DDP_vs_DeepSpeed_cls_task?workspace=user-smangrul) along with benchmarking table comparing DDP vs DeepSpeed. \n\n![Wandb Run](./assets/83_accelerate_deepspeed/cls_run.png)",

The rest of the process of using the config with \ud83e\udd17 `accelerate` is similar to the above experiment.\n```json\n{\n    \"fp16\": {\n        \"enabled\": true,\n        \"loss_scale\": 0,\n        \"loss_scale_window\": 1000,\n        \"initial_scale_power\": 16,",

You can always try it to speed things a tiny bit to only shard the optimizer states with:\n\n\n```json\n{\n    \"zero_optimization\": {\n        \"stage\": 1\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n<a id='deepspeed-nvme'></a>\n\n### NVMe Support\n\nZeRO-Infinity allows for training incredibly large models by extending GPU and CPU memory with NVMe memory. Thanks to\nsmart partitioning and tiling algorithms each GPU needs to send and receive very small amounts of data during\noffloading so modern NVMe proved to be fit to allow for an even larger total memory pool available to your training\nprocess.

      "## Putting Bias in Context\n\nThe first and maybe most important concept to consider when dealing with machine bias is **context**. In their foundational work on [bias in NLP](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.485.pdf), Su Lin Blodgett et al. point out that: _\u201c[T]he majority of [academic works on machine bias] fail to engage critically with what constitutes \u201cbias\u201d in the first place\u201d_, including by building their work on top of _\u201cunstated assumptions about what kinds of system behaviors are harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why\u201d_.",
      "Conceptualizing bias as a risk factor then allows us to better understand the **shared responsibility** for machine biases between developers at all stages. Bias can never be fully removed, not least because the definitions of social biases and the power dynamics that tie them to discrimination vary vastly across social contexts. However:",
      "Now let\u2019s dive deeper into the issue of linking biases in stand-alone/context-less ML artifacts to specific harms. It can be useful to think of **machine biases as risk factors for discrimination-based harms**. Take the example of a text-to-image model that over-represents light skin tones when prompted to create a picture of a person in a professional setting, but produces darker skin tones [when the prompts mention criminality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03759). These tendencies would be what we call _machine biases at the model level_. Now let\u2019s think about a few systems that use such a text-to-image model:",
      "In order to better understand and address these risks, ML researchers and developers have started studying _machine bias_ or _algorithmic bias_, mechanisms that might lead systems to, for example, encode **negative stereotypes or associations** or to have **disparate performance** for different population groups in their deployment context.",
      "So, who\u2019s on the hook for machine biases in ML? These three cases illustrate one of the reasons why discussions about the responsibility of ML developers in addressing bias can get so complicated: depending on decisions made at other points in the ML system development process by other people, the biases in an ML dataset or model may land anywhere between being irrelevant to the application settings and directly leading to grievous harm. However, in all of these cases, **stronger biases in the model/dataset increase the risk of negative outcomes**. The European Union has started to develop frameworks that address this phenomenon in [recent regulatory efforts](https://ec.europa",
      "1. Each stage of the development process, from task specification, dataset curation, and model training, to model integration and system deployment, can take steps to minimize the aspects of machine bias** that most directly depend on its choices** and technical decisions, and\n2. Clear communication and **information flow between the various ML development stages** can make the difference between making choices that build on top of each other to attenuate the negative potential of bias (multipronged approach to bias mitigation, as in deployment scenario 1 above) _versus_ making choices that compound this negative potential to exacerbate the risk of harm (as in deployment scenario 3).\n\nIn the next section, we review these various stages along with some of the tools that can help us address machine bias at each of them.\n\n\n## Addressing Bias throughout the ML Development Cycle",
      "This example serves to illustrate that the impact of machine biases in an ML-supported product depends not just on where we decide to leverage ML, but also on how ML techniques are integrated into the broader technical system, and with what objective. When first investigating how ML can fit into a product or a use case you are interested in, we first recommend looking for the failure modes of the system through the lens of bias before even diving into the available models or datasets - which behaviors of existing systems in the space will be particularly harmful or more likely to occur if bias is exacerbated by ML predictions?"

And, as mentioned previously, the padding value used to pad the labels should be `-100` and not the padding token of the tokenizer, to make sure those padded values are ignored in the loss computation.",

We want to pad our examples to the longest sentence in the batch, which is done by the `DataCollatorWithPadding` collator. And this data collator is supposed to be used by default by the `Trainer`, so why is it not used here?\n\nThe answer is because we did not pass the `tokenizer` to the `Trainer`, so it couldn't create the `DataCollatorWithPadding` we want. In practice, you should never hesitate to explicitly pass along the data collator you want to use, to make sure you avoid these kinds of errors. Let's adapt our code to do exactly that:",

      ". These are DefaultDataCollator and DataCollatorWithPadding. These are the ones you should use if your labels are straightforward and your data doesn't need any special processing before being ready for training. Most sequence classification tasks, for example, would use one of these data collators. Remember that because different models have different padding tokens, DataCollatorWithPadding will need your model's Tokenizer so it knows how to pad sequences properly! So how do you choose one of these? Simple: As you can see here, if you have variable sequence lengths then you should use DataCollatorWithPadding, which will pad all your sequences to the same length"

      "## Natural language processing\n\nNLP tasks are among the most common types of tasks because text is such a natural way for us to communicate. To get text into a format recognized by a model, it needs to be tokenized. This means dividing a sequence of text into separate words or subwords (tokens) and then converting these tokens into numbers. As a result, you can represent a sequence of text as a sequence of numbers, and once you have a sequence of numbers, it can be input into a model to solve all sorts of NLP tasks!\n\n### Text classification\n\nLike classification tasks in any modality, text classification labels a sequence of text (it can be sentence-level, a paragraph, or a document) from a predefined set of classes. There are many practical applications for text classification, some of which include:",
      "We'll focus on mT5, an interesting architecture based on T5 that was pretrained in a text-to-text framework. In T5, every NLP task is formulated in terms of a prompt prefix like `summarize:` which conditions the model to adapt the generated text to the prompt. As shown in the figure below, this makes T5 extremely versatile, as you can solve many tasks with a single model!",
      "## Overview\n\nThe ELECTRA model was proposed in the paper [ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than\nGenerators](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1xMH1BtvB). ELECTRA is a new pretraining approach which trains two\ntransformer models: the generator and the discriminator. The generator's role is to replace tokens in a sequence, and\nis therefore trained as a masked language model. The discriminator, which is the model we're interested in, tries to\nidentify which tokens were replaced by the generator in the sequence.\n\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:",

The inputs are corrupted by that language model, which takes an input text that is randomly masked and outputs a text in which ELECTRA has to predict which token is an original and which one has been replaced. Like for GAN training, the small language model is trained for a few steps (but with the original texts as objective, not to fool the ELECTRA model like in a traditional GAN setting) then the ELECTRA model is trained for a few steps.\n- The ELECTRA checkpoints saved using [Google Research's implementation](https://github.com/google-research/electra)\n  contain both the generator and discriminator.

    "retrieved_docs": [
      "#### Batch Size\n\nIt is worth noting that the largest speed gains with speculative decoding come with a batch size of 1. For batched \nspeculative decoding, all candidate tokens **across the batch** must match the validation tokens in order for the tokens \nto be accepted. If a token in the batch at a given position does not agree, all candidate tokens that proceed the position \nare discarded. Consequently, speculative decoding favours lower batch sizes. In practice, we find that speculative decoding \nprovides a speed-up until a batch size of 4. Above batch size 4, speculative decoding returns slower inference than the \nmain model alone. For full results, refer to Section D.3 of the [Distil-Whisper paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00430.pdf).\n\n## Conclusion",
      "### Speculative Decoding\n\nSpeculative decoding (also known as assisted decoding) is a modification of the decoding strategies above, that uses an\nassistant model (ideally a much smaller one) with the same tokenizer, to generate a few candidate tokens. The main\nmodel then validates the candidate tokens in a single forward pass, which speeds up the decoding process. If\n`do_sample=True`, then the token validation with resampling introduced in the\n[speculative decoding paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.17192.pdf) is used.\n\nCurrently, only greedy search and sampling are supported with assisted decoding, and assisted decoding doesn't support batched inputs.\nTo learn more about assisted decoding, check [this blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/assisted-generation).",
      "### Speculative Decoding\n\nNow let's load the assistant model for speculative decoding. In this example, we'll use a distilled variant of Whisper, \n[distil-large-v2](https://huggingface.co/distil-whisper/distil-large-v2). The distilled model copies the entire encoder \nfrom Whisper, but only 2 of the 32 decoder layers. As such, it runs 6x faster than Whisper, while performing to within \n1% WER on out-of-distribution test sets. This makes it the perfect choice as an assistant model, since it has both \nhigh transcription accuracy and fast generation \\\\({}^1\\\\).",
      "## Conclusion\n\nThe research community is constantly coming up with new, nifty ways to speed up inference time for ever-larger LLMs. As an example, one such promising research direction is [speculative decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17192) where \"easy tokens\" are generated by smaller, faster language models and only \"hard tokens\" are generated by the LLM itself. Going into more detail is out of the scope of this notebook, but can be read upon in this [nice blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/assisted-generation).",
      "## Speculative Decoding\n\nSpeculative Decoding was proposed in [Fast Inference from Transformers via Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17192) \nby Yaniv Leviathan et. al. from Google. It works on the premise that a faster, **assistant model** very often generates the same tokens as a larger **main model**.\n\nFirst, the assistant model auto-regressively generates a sequence of \\\\( N \\\\) *candidate tokens*, \\\\( \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}_{1:N} \\\\). \nIn the diagram below, the assistant model generates a sequence of 5 candidate tokens: `The quick brown sock jumps`.",
      "In this blog post, we demonstrate how Speculative Decoding can be employed to reduce the \ninference time of Whisper by a **factor of 2**, while mathematically ensuring exactly the **same outputs** are achieved \nfrom the model. As a result, this method provides a perfect drop-in replacement for existing Whisper pipelines, since it \nprovides free 2x speed-up while maintaining the same accuracy. For a more streamlined version of the blog post \nwith fewer explanations but all the code, see the accompanying [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sanchit-gandhi/notebooks/blob/main/speculative_decoding.ipynb).\n\n## Speculative Decoding",
      "## Strategies for Efficient Speculative Decoding\n\nIn this final section, we cover two strategies for ensuring the fastest possible inference time with speculative decoding.\n\n#### Assistant Model\n\nOur objective is to select an assistant model that is at least 3x faster than the main model **and** transcribes at least\n70-80% of the predicted tokens correctly, typically the \"easier\" tokens in the examples. If you have a particular \nlanguage in which you want to transcribe, an effective strategy is to train two Whisper models of different sizes, and \nuse one as the assistant to the other:"

      "## Graph representations through ML\n\nThe usual process to work on graphs with machine learning is first to generate a meaningful representation for your items of interest (nodes, edges, or full graphs depending on your task), then to use these to train a predictor for your target task. We want (as in other modalities) to constrain the mathematical representations of your objects so that similar objects are mathematically close. However, this similarity is hard to define strictly in graph ML: for example, are two nodes more similar when they have the same labels or the same neighbours?",
      "At each new layer, the node representation includes more and more nodes. \n\nA node, through the first layer, is the aggregation of its direct neighbours. Through the second layer, it is still the aggregation of its direct neighbours, but this time, their representations include their own neighbours (from the first layer). After n layers, the representation of all nodes becomes an aggregation of all their neighbours at distance n, therefore, of the full graph if its diameter is smaller than n! \n\nIf your network has too many layers, there is a risk that each node becomes an aggregation of the full graph (and that node representations converge to the same one for all nodes). This is called **the oversmoothing problem**\n\nThis can be solved by :",
      "However, these methods have limits: they cannot obtain embeddings for new nodes, do not capture structural similarity between nodes finely, and cannot use added features.\n\n## Graph Neural Networks\n\nNeural networks can generalise to unseen data. Given the representation constraints we evoked earlier, what should a good neural network be to work on graphs?\n\nIt should:"

      "# T2I-Adapter\n\n[T2I-Adapter]((https://hf.co/papers/2302.08453)) is a lightweight adapter model that provides an additional conditioning input image (line art, canny, sketch, depth, pose) to better control image generation. It is similar to a ControlNet, but it is a lot smaller (~77M parameters and ~300MB file size) because its only inserts weights into the UNet instead of copying and training it.\n\nThe T2I-Adapter is only available for training with the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) model.",
      "In our Single-Node Multi-GPU setup, the maximum batch size that DDP supports without OOM error is 100. In contrast, DeepSpeed Zero-Stage 2 enables batch size of 200 without running into OOM errors. Therefore, DeepSpeed enables to fit **2X** more data per GPU when compared to DDP. We observe ~**1.44X** speedup in training and ~**1.23X** speedup in evaluation as we are able to fit more data on the same available hardware. As this model is of medium size, the speedup isn't that exciting but this will improve with bigger models",
      "Training a model can be taxing on your hardware, but if you enable `gradient_checkpointing` and `mixed_precision`, it is possible to train a model on a single 24GB GPU. If you're training with larger batch sizes or want to train faster, it's better to use GPUs with more than 30GB of memory. You can reduce your memory footprint by enabling memory-efficient attention with [xFormers](../optimization/xformers). JAX/Flax training is also supported for efficient training on TPUs and GPUs, but it doesn't support gradient checkpointing, gradient accumulation or xFormers. A GPU with at least 30GB of memory or a TPU v3 is recommended for training with Flax.",

FSDP with Zero-Stage 3 is able to be run on 2 GPUs with batch size of 5 (effective batch size =10 (5 X 2)). FSDP with CPU offload can further increase the max batch size to 14 per GPU when using 2 GPUs. **FSDP with CPU offload enables training GPT-2 1.5B model on a single GPU with a batch size of 10**. This enables ML practitioners with minimal compute resources to train such large models, thereby democratizing large model training.\n\n## Capabilities and limitations of the FSDP Integration",

We can afford `4` due to having an A100, but if you have a GPU with lower VRAM we recommend bringing this value down to `1`.\n- `num_train_epochs`: Each epoch corresponds to how many times the images in the training set will be \"seen\" by the model. We experimented with 3 epochs, but turns out the best results required just a bit more than 1 epoch, with 3 epochs our model overfit.\n- `checkpointing_steps`: Save an intermediary checkpoint every `x` steps (in our case `5000`).

The Hub has model and dataset versioning tools, including model cards and client-side libraries to automate the versioning process. However, only including a model card with hyperparameters is not enough to provide the best reproducibility; this is where notebooks can help. Alongside these models, datasets, and demos, the Hub hosts over 7,000 notebooks. These notebooks often document the development process of a model or a dataset and can provide guidance and tutorials showing how others can use these resources. We\u2019re therefore excited about our improved support for notebook hosting on the Hub. \n\n## What have we changed?",
      "## Why are we excited to host more notebooks on the Hub? \n\n- Notebooks help document how people can use your models and datasets; sharing notebooks in the same place as your models and datasets makes it easier for others to use the resources you have created and shared on the Hub. \n- Many people use the Hub to develop a Machine Learning portfolio. You can now supplement this portfolio with Jupyter Notebooks too. \n- Support for one-click direct opening notebooks hosted on the Hub in [Google Colab](https://medium.com/google-colab/hugging-face-notebooks-x-colab-722d91e05e7c), making notebooks on the Hub an even more powerful experience.

The Sentence Transformer model then trains on these pairs (or triplets) and generates dense vectors per example.

      "- #### **Get guidance on selecting the right ML library.**\nThe Hugging Face Expert suggested using the Sentence Transformers Fine-tuning library (aka [SetFit](https://github.com/huggingface/setfit)), an efficient framework for few-shot fine-tuning of Sentence Transformers models. Combining contrastive learning and semantic sentence similarity, SetFit achieves high accuracy on text classification tasks with very little labeled data.\n\n```diff\nJulien Simon, Chief Evangelist at Hugging Face: \n\u201cSetFit for text classification tasks is a great tool to add to the ML toolbox\u201d \n```\n\nThe Witty Works team found the performance was adequate with as little as 15-20  labeled sentences per specific word.",
      "The resulting sentence embedding serves as input for a classical classifier based on KNN or logistic regression to build a context-dependent classifier of non-inclusive words.\n\n```diff\nElena Nazarenko, Lead Data Scientist at Witty Works: \n\u201cWe generate contextualized embedding vectors for every word depending on its \nsentence (BERT embedding). Then, we keep only the embedding for the \u201cproblem\u201d \nword\u2019s token, and calculate the smallest angle (cosine similarity)\u201d  \n```\n\nTo fine-tune a vanilla transformers-based classifier, such as a simple BERT model, Witty Works would have needed a substantial amount of annotated data. Hundreds of samples for each category of flagged words would have been necessary. However, such an annotation process would have been costly and time-consuming, which Witty Works couldn\u2019t afford."

While the issues of those models' not being released for further study is frequently discussed, the hidden knowledge about how to train such models rarely gets any attention. This article aims to change this by shedding some light on the technology and engineering behind training such models both in terms of hardware and software on the example of the 176B parameter language model [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom).",
      "After GPT-2, language models grew even bigger and are now known as *large language models (LLMs)*. LLMs demonstrate few- or even zero-shot learning if pretrained on a large enough dataset.

GPT-J was followed by [OPT](model_doc/opt), a family of decoder-only models, the largest of which is 175B and trained on 180B tokens.

      "Almost 6 months ago to the day, [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/) released [GPT-J 6B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B), an open-source alternative to [OpenAIs GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/).  [GPT-J 6B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) is the 6 billion parameter successor to [EleutherAIs](https://www.eleuther.ai/) GPT-NEO family, a family of transformer-based language models based on the GPT architecture for text generation.",
      "---\n\n## Background\n\nThe weights of the 6 billion parameter model represent a ~24GB memory footprint. To load it in float32, one would need at least 2x model size CPU RAM: 1x for initial weights and another 1x to load the checkpoint. So for `GPT-J` it would require at least 48GB of CPU RAM to just load the model.\n\nTo make the model more accessible, [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/) also provides float16 weights, and `transformers` has new options to reduce the memory footprint when loading large language models. Combining all this it should take roughly 12.1GB of CPU RAM to load the model.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import GPTJForCausalLM\nimport torch",
      "## Conclusion\n\nWe successfully managed to deploy `GPT-J`, a 6 billion parameter language model created by [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/), using Amazon SageMaker. We reduced the model load time from 3.5 minutes down to 8 seconds to be able to run scalable, reliable inference. \n\nRemember that using `torch.save()` and `torch.load()` can create incompatibility issues. If you want to learn more about scaling out your Amazon SageMaker Endpoints check out my other blog post: [\u201cMLOps: End-to-End Hugging Face Transformers with the Hub & SageMaker Pipelines\u201d](https://www.philschmid.de/mlops-sagemaker-huggingface-transformers).\n\n---",
      "**Why do we need a quantized GPT model?**\n\nRunning Vicuna-13B model in fp16 requires around 28GB GPU RAM. To\nfurther reduce the memory footprint, optimization techniques are\nrequired. There is a recent research paper GPTQ published, which\nproposed accurate post-training quantization for GPT models with lower\nbit precision. As illustrated below, for models with parameters larger\nthan 10B, the 4-bit or 3-bit GPTQ can achieve comparable accuracy\nwith fp16.",
      "[EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/)'s primary goal is to train a model that is equivalent in size to GPT\u2060-\u20603 and make it available to the public under an open license. \n\nOver the last 6 months, `GPT-J` gained a lot of interest from Researchers, Data Scientists, and even Software Developers, but it remained very challenging to deploy `GPT-J` into production for real-world use cases and products. \n\nThere are some hosted solutions to use `GPT-J` for production workloads, like the [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api), or for experimenting using  [EleutherAIs 6b playground](https://6b.eleuther.ai/), but fewer examples on how to easily deploy it into your own environment."

      "## Tips\n\n- Not all adapter types can be combined. See `peft.tuners.mixed.COMPATIBLE_TUNER_TYPES` for a list of compatible types. An error will be raised if you are trying to combine incompatible adapter types.\n- It is possible to mix multiple adapters of the same type. This can be useful to combine adapters with very different configs.\n- If you want to combine a lot of different adapters, it is most performant to add the same types of adapters consecutively. E.g., add LoRA1, LoRA2, LoHa1, LoHa2 in this order, instead of LoRA1, LoHa1, LoRA2, LoHa2. The order will make a difference for the outcome in most cases, but since no order is better a priori, it is best to choose the order that is most performant.",
      "Currently, the main purpose of mixed adapter types is to combine trained adapters for inference. Although it is technically also possible to train a mixed adapter model, this has not been tested and is not recommended.\n\n## Tips",
      "# Working with mixed adapter types\n\nNormally, it is not possible to mix different adapter types in \ud83e\udd17 PEFT. For example, even though it is possible to create a PEFT model that has two different LoRA adapters (that can have different config options), it is not possible to combine a LoRA adapter with a LoHa adapter. However, by using a mixed model, this works as long as the adapter types are compatible.\n\n## Loading different adapter types into a PEFT model\n\nTo load different adapter types into a PEFT model, proceed the same as if you were loading two adapters of the same type, but use `PeftMixedModel` instead of `PeftModel`:\n\n```py\nfrom peft import PeftMixedModel",
      "**0 performance degradation when merging adapters**: (Read more about adapters and PEFT in [this blogpost](https://huggingface.co/blog/peft) if you are not familiar with it).

      "-->\n\n# DreamBooth fine-tuning with LoRA\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to use LoRA, a low-rank approximation technique, to fine-tune DreamBooth with the \n`CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4` model. \n\nAlthough LoRA was initially designed as a technique for reducing the number of trainable parameters in \nlarge-language models, the technique can also be applied to diffusion models. Performing a complete model fine-tuning \nof diffusion models is a time-consuming task, which is why lightweight techniques like DreamBooth or Textual Inversion \ngained popularity. With the introduction of LoRA, customizing and fine-tuning a model on a specific dataset has become \neven faster.",
      "Instead of fine-tuning the model by performing tiny changes to all its weights, we freeze most of the layers and only train a few specific ones in the attention blocks. Furthermore, we avoid touching the parameters of those layers by adding the product of two smaller matrices to the original weights. Those small matrices are the ones whose weights are updated during the fine-tuning process, and then saved to disk. This means that all of the model original parameters are preserved, and we can load the LoRA weights on top using an adaptation method.\n\nThe LoRA name (Low Rank Adaptation) comes from the small matrices we mentioned. For more information about the method, please refer to [this post](https://huggingface.co/blog/lora) or the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)."

While the required peak memory for the \\\\( \\mathbf{QK}^T \\\\) matrix is significantly reduced, holding the key-value cache in memory can become very memory expensive for long input sequences or multi-turn chat. Remember that the key-value cache needs to store the key-value vectors for all previous input vectors \\\\( \\mathbf{x}_i \\text{, for } i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, c - 1\\} \\\\) for all self-attention layers and for all attention heads.",

E.g. for the example above the LLM needs to understand that the user refers to the population when asking `\"And how many are in Germany\"`.\n  2. The key-value cache is extremely useful for chat as it allows us to continuously grow the encoded chat history instead of having to re-encode the chat history again from scratch (as e.g. would be the case when using an encoder-decoder architecture).\n\nIn `transformers`, a `generate` call will return `past_key_values` when `return_dict_in_generate=True` is passed, in addition to the default `use_cache=True`.

      "The [`~Dataset.map`] function converts the returned values to a PyArrow-supported format. But explicitly returning the tensors as NumPy arrays is faster because it is a natively supported PyArrow format.

      "Data types\n\nDatasets supported by Datasets Server have a tabular format, meaning a data point is represented in a row and its features are contained in columns. Using the `/first-rows` endpoint allows you to preview the first 100 rows of a dataset and information about each feature. Within the `features` key, you'll notice it returns a `_type` field. This value describes the data type of the column, and it is also known as a dataset's [`Features`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/about_dataset_features).",

Knowing a dataset feature gives you a better understanding of the data type you're working with, and how you can preprocess it.\n\nFor example, the `/first-rows` endpoint for the [Rotten Tomatoes](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rotten_tomatoes) dataset returns the following:",

You can verify for yourself that the type of `drug_dataset[\"train\"]` is `Dataset`, irrespective of the output format.\n\n</Tip>\n\n\nFrom here we can use all the Pandas functionality that we want.

This function only changes the _output format_ of the dataset, so you can easily switch to another format without affecting the underlying _data format_, which is Apache Arrow.

      ". To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, which achieves O(L logL) in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.*",
      "*Many real-world applications require the prediction of long sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption planning. Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture",
      "-->\n\n# Informer\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Informer model was proposed in [Informer: Beyond Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07436) by Haoyi Zhou, Shanghang Zhang, Jieqi Peng, Shuai Zhang, Jianxin Li, Hui Xiong, and Wancai Zhang.\n\nThis method introduces a Probabilistic Attention mechanism to select the \"active\" queries rather than the \"lazy\" queries and provides a sparse Transformer thus mitigating the quadratic compute and memory requirements of vanilla attention.\n\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:",
      "1. **Quadratic computation of canonical self-attention:** The vanilla Transformer has a computational complexity of \\\\(O(T^2 D)\\\\) where \\\\(T\\\\) is the time series length and \\\\(D\\\\) is the dimension of the hidden states. For long sequence time-series forecasting (also known as the _LSTF problem_), this might be really computationally expensive. To solve this problem, Informer employs a new self-attention mechanism called _ProbSparse_ attention, which has \\\\(O(T \\log T)\\\\) time and space complexity.",
      "## Introduction\n\nA few months ago, we introduced the [Informer](https://huggingface.co/blog/informer) model ([Zhou, Haoyi, et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07436)), which is a Time Series Transformer that won the AAAI 2021 best paper award. We also provided an example for multivariate probabilistic forecasting with Informer. In this post, we discuss the question: [Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13504) (AAAI 2023). As we will see, they are.",
      ".org/abs/2012.07436)), AAAI21 best paper which is [now available](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/informer) in \ud83e\udd17 Transformers. We will show how to use the Informer model for the **multivariate** probabilistic forecasting task, i.e., predicting the distribution of a future **vector** of time-series target values. Note that this will also work for the vanilla Time Series Transformer model.",
      "*Extending the forecasting time is a critical demand for real applications, such as extreme weather early warning and long-term energy consumption planning. This paper studies the long-term forecasting problem of time series. Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms to discover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns of the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies. Also, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information utilization bottleneck. Going beyond Transformers, we design Autoformer as a novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We break with the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a basic inner block of deep models"

Therefore, by default diffusion pipelines are always instantiated on CPU with float32 precision if not otherwise defined by the user. This ensures usability across different platforms and accelerators and means that no complex installations are required to run the library.\n- Diffusers aims to be a **light-weight** package and therefore has very few required dependencies, but many soft dependencies that can improve performance (such as `accelerate`, `safetensors`, `onnx`, etc...).

This can be seen in the following code:\n\n```py\n>>> dataset.shard(num_shards=4, index=0)\n```\n\nThis line of code indicates that the dataset is being split into 4 shards, with the `index` parameter set to 0, which returns the first shard.",
    "retrieved_docs": [
      "## Sharded Parquet files\n\nBig datasets are partitioned into Parquet files (shards) of about 500MB each. The filename contains the name of the dataset, the split, the shard index, and the total number of shards (`dataset-name-train-0000-of-0004.parquet`). For a given split, the elements in the list are sorted by their shard index, in ascending order. For example, the `train` split of the [`amazon_polarity`](https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/parquet?dataset=amazon_polarity) dataset is partitioned into 4 shards:",
      "### Shard\n\n\ud83e\udd17 Datasets supports sharding to divide a very large dataset into a predefined number of chunks. Specify the `num_shards` parameter in [`~Dataset.shard`] to determine the number of shards to split the dataset into. You'll also need to provide the shard you want to return with the `index` parameter.\n\nFor example, the [imdb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb) dataset has 25000 examples:",

      "We then take these tokenized samples in batches and serialize those batches as multiple TFRecord shards, where the total dataset length and individual shard size determine the number of shards. Finally, these shards are pushed to a [Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/buckets).\n\nIf you\u2019re using a TPU node for training, then the data needs to be streamed from a GCS bucket since the node host memory is very small. But for TPU VMs, we can use datasets locally or even attach persistent storage to those VMs. Since TPU nodes are still quite heavily used, we based our example on using a GCS bucket for data storage.",

Docker Spaces allow users to go beyond the limits of what was previously possible with the standard SDKs. From FastAPI and Go endpoints to Phoenix apps and ML Ops tools, Docker Spaces can help in many different setups.\n\n## Setting up Docker Spaces",

You can use Spaces to host [Gradio](gradio.app/) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) applications, or you can use Spaces to [custom docker images](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker). Using Gradio and Spaces in combination often means you can have an application created and hosted with access for others to use within minutes. You can use Spaces to host a Docker image if you want complete control over your application",

Although the processing functions of Datasets will cover most the cases needed to train a model, there are times when you\u2019ll need to switch to a library like Pandas to access more powerful features or high-level APIs for visualisation. Fortunately, Datasets is designed to be interoperable with libraries like Pandas, as well as NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. In this video, we'll take a look at how we can quickly switch our data to Pandas DataFrames and back. As an example, let's suppose we're analysing Supreme Court cases from Switzerland",

      "### Support for large datasets\n\nThe Hub can host large datasets; it currently hosts datasets with multiple TBs of data.The datasets library, which users can use to download and process datasets from the Hub, supports streaming, making it possible to work with large datasets without downloading the entire dataset upfront. This can be invaluable for allowing researchers with less computational resources to work with your datasets, or to select small portions of a huge dataset for testing, development or prototyping.",
      "To handle these large datasets, the Datasets library is built on two core features: the Apache Arrow format and a streaming API. Arrow is designed for high-performance data processing and represents each table-like dataset with an in-memory columnar format. As you can see in this example, columnar formats group the elements of a table in consecutive blocks of RAM and this unlocks fast access and processing. Arrow is great at processing data at any scale, but some datasets are so large that you can't even fit them on your hard disk. For these cases, the Datasets library provides a streaming API that allows you to progressively download the raw data one element at a time. The result is a special object called an IterableDataset that we'll see in more detail soon",
      "The [\ud83e\udd17 `datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) library allows you to programmatically interact with the datasets, so you can easily use datasets from the Hub in your projects. With a single line of code, you can access the datasets; even if they are so large they don't fit in your computer, you can use streaming to efficiently access the data.\n\n## Spaces\n\n[Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) is a simple way to host ML demo apps on the Hub.

(Source: Document 1)\n\nIn other words, transfer learning means that the new model \"transfers\" the knowledge of the pretrained model to itself, allowing it to learn from the experiences of the pretrained model more quickly and efficiently.

      "For example, one could leverage a pretrained model trained on the English language and then fine-tune it on an arXiv corpus, resulting in a science/research-based model. The fine-tuning will only require a limited amount of data: the knowledge the pretrained model has acquired is \"transferred,\" hence the term *transfer learning*.",
      "## Transfer Learning[[transfer-learning]]\n\n<Youtube id=\"BqqfQnyjmgg\" />\n\n*Pretraining* is the act of training a model from scratch: the weights are randomly initialized, and the training starts without any prior knowledge.",
      ". BERT was pretrained this way using the English Wikipedia and 11,000 unpublished books. In practice, transfer learning is applied on a given model by throwing away its head, that is, its last layers focused on the pretraining objective, and replacing it with a new, randomly initialized, head suitable for the task at hand. For instance, when we fine-tuned a BERT model earlier, we removed the head that classified mask words and replaced it with a classifier with 2 outputs, since our task had two labels. To be as efficient as possible, the pretrained model used should be as similar as possible to the task it\u2019s fine-tuned on. For instance, if the problem it\u2019s to classify German sentences, it\u2019s best to use a German pretrained model. But with the good comes the bad",
      "Up until now, we've mostly been using pretrained models and fine-tuning them for new use cases by reusing the weights from pretraining. As we saw in [Chapter 1](/course/chapter1), this is commonly referred to as _transfer learning_, and it's a very successful strategy for applying Transformer models to most real-world use cases where labeled data is sparse. In this chapter, we'll take a different approach and train a completely new model from scratch. This is a good approach to take if you have a lot of data and it is very different from the pretraining data used for the available models. However, it also requires considerably more compute resources to pretrain a language model than just to fine-tune an existing one",
      ". On the left, it\u2019s trained from scratch, and on the right, it\u2019s fine-tuning a pretrained model. As we can see, using transfer learning and the pretrained model yields better results. And it doesn\u2019t matter if we train longer, the training from scratch is capped around 70% accuracy while the pretrained model beats the 86% easily. This is because pretrained models are usually trained on large amounts of data that provide the model with a statistical understanding of the language used during pretraining. In computer vision, transfer learning has been applied successfully for almost ten years. Models are frequently pretrained on ImageNet, a dataset containing 1.2 millions of photo images. Each image is classified by one of 1000 labels",
      "This type of model develops a statistical understanding of the language it has been trained on, but it's not very useful for specific practical tasks. Because of this, the general pretrained model then goes through a process called *transfer learning*. During this process, the model is fine-tuned in a supervised way -- that is, using human-annotated labels -- on a given task.\n\nAn example of a task is predicting the next word in a sentence having read the *n* previous words. This is called *causal language modeling* because the output depends on the past and present inputs, but not the future ones."

      "## Adding a new fine-tuning method\n\nNew parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods are developed all the time. If you would like to add a new, promising method to PEFT, please follow these steps.\n\n**Requirements**",
      "[[open-in-colab]]\n\n[Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)](https://huggingface.co/blog/peft) methods freeze the pretrained model parameters during fine-tuning and add a small number of trainable parameters (the adapters) on top of it. The adapters are trained to learn task-specific information. This approach has been shown to be very memory-efficient with lower compute usage while producing results comparable to a fully fine-tuned model. \n\nAdapters trained with PEFT are also usually an order of magnitude smaller than the full model, making it convenient to share, store, and load them.",
      "### PEFT: Personalization at the tip of your fingers\nSometimes, you may want more controlled personalization, without enough memory to load a whole model in memory to fine tune it. Did you know that you don't need to use an entire model when fine-tuning?\n\nYou might want to use what is called **parameter efficient fine-tuning** (PEFT).\nThis technique first freezes up the parameters of your pretrained model of interest, then adds a number of new parameters on top of it, called the adapters. What you then fine-tune on your task are only the (lightweight) adapter weights, considerably smaller than the original model. You then just need to share your small adapter weights (and the base model)! You'll find a list of interesting approaches for PEFT [here](https://github.com/huggingface/peft).",
      "## Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)\n\nIf you\u2019d like to fine-tune one of the existing large models on your instruction dataset, it is nearly impossible to do so on consumer hardware and later deploy them (since the instruction models are the same size as the original checkpoints that are used for fine-tuning). [PEFT](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index) is a library that allows you to do parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. This means that rather than training the whole model, you can train a very small number of additional parameters, enabling much faster training with very little performance degradation. With PEFT, you can do low-rank adaptation (LoRA), prefix tuning, prompt tuning, and p-tuning.\n\n\nYou can check out further resources for more information on text generation.",
      "-->\n\n# PEFT\n\n\ud83e\udd17 PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) is a library for efficiently adapting large pretrained models to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all of a model's parameters because it is prohibitively costly. PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters - significantly decreasing computational and storage costs - while yielding performance comparable to a fully fine-tuned model. This makes it more accessible to train and store large language models (LLMs) on consumer hardware.\n\nPEFT is integrated with the Transformers, Diffusers, and Accelerate libraries to provide a faster and easier way to load, train, and use large models for inference.",
      "It also helps in portability wherein users can tune models using PEFT methods to get tiny checkpoints worth a few MBs compared to the large checkpoints of full fine-tuning, e.g., `bigscience/mt0-xxl` takes up 40GB of storage and full fine-tuning will lead to 40GB checkpoints for each downstream dataset whereas using PEFT methods it would be just a few MBs for each downstream dataset all the while achieving comparable performance to full fine-tuning.  The small trained weights from PEFT approaches are added on top of the pretrained LLM. So the same LLM can be used for multiple tasks by adding small weights without having to replace the entire model.\n\n**In short, PEFT approaches enable you to get performance comparable to full fine-tuning while only having a small number of trainable parameters.**",

The `from_pretrained()` method lets you quickly load a pretrained model for any architecture so you don't have to devote time and resources to train a model from scratch.

Also, the model we've uploaded is going to be accessible to you and, if it's shared publicly, to anyone else. So if you want to load that model all you, or anyone else, needs to do is just to load it in either a pipeline or you can just load it with, for example, TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification and then for the name you would just simply pass the path to the repo you want to upload - or to download, excuse me"

This operation does not change the audio in-place, \nbut rather signals to `datasets` to resample audio samples _on the fly_ the \nfirst time that they are loaded:",
      "It is crucial that we match the sampling rate of our audio inputs to the sampling\nrate expected by our model, as audio signals with different sampling rates have very\ndifferent distributions. Audio samples should only ever be processed with the \ncorrect sampling rate. Failing to do so can lead to unexpected results!\nFor instance, taking an audio sample with a sampling rate of 16kHz and listening \nto it with a sampling rate of 8kHz will make the audio sound as though it's in half-speed. \nIn the same way, passing audio with the wrong sampling rate can falter an ASR model \nthat expects one sampling rate and receives another. The Whisper \nfeature extractor expects audio inputs with a sampling rate of 16kHz, so we need to \nmatch our inputs to this value. We don't want to inadvertently train an ASR \nsystem on slow-motion speech!",
      "If you look at the `sampling_rate`, you'll see the audio was sampled at 48kHz. The Whisper model was pretrained on audio inputs at 16kHZ which means you'll need to downsample the audio inputs to match what the model was pretrained on. Downsample the audio by using the [`~datasets.Dataset.cast_column`] method on the `audio` column, and set the `sampling_rate` to 16kHz.

Samples shorter than 30s are padded to 30s\nby appending zeros to the end of the sequence (zeros in an audio signal corresponding to no signal\nor silence). Samples longer than 30s are truncated to 30s. Since all elements \nin the batch are padded/truncated to a maximum length in the input space, we don't require \nan attention mask when forwarding the audio inputs to the Whisper model. \nWhisper is unique in this regard - with most audio models, you can expect to provide \nan attention mask that details where sequences have been padded, and thus where they\nshould be ignored in the self-attention mechanism.

      "Custom Python Spaces\n\n<Tip>\n\nSpaces now support arbitrary Dockerfiles so you can host any Python app directly using [Docker Spaces](./spaces-sdks-docker).\n\n</Tip>\n\nWhile not an official workflow, you are able to run your own Python + interface stack in Spaces by selecting Gradio as your SDK and serving a frontend on port `7680`. See the [templates](https://huggingface.co/templates#spaces) for examples.\n\nSpaces are served in iframes, which by default restrict links from opening in the parent page. The simplest solution is to open them in a new window:",
      "Spaces make hosting and making your application accessible for others to use much more straightforward. You can use Spaces to host [Gradio](gradio.app/) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) applications, or you can use Spaces to [custom docker images](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker). Using Gradio and Spaces in combination often means you can have an application created and hosted with access for others to use within minutes. You can use Spaces to host a Docker image if you want complete control over your application",
      "## Redirect URLs \n\nYou can use any redirect URL you want, as long as it targets your Space.\n\nNote that `SPACE_HOST` is [available](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-overview#helper-environment-variables) as an environment variable.\n\nFor example, you can use `https://{SPACE_HOST}/login/callback` as a redirect URI.\n\n## Scopes\n\nThe following scopes are always included for Spaces:\n\n- `openid`: Get the ID token in addition to the access token.\n- `profile`: Get the user's profile information (username, avatar, etc.)",
      "In the upper-right hand corner of your space you'll see a button with three dots\nwhich, when you click on it, will offer you a menu option to \"Embed this Space\".\n(See [the HuggingFace\ndocumentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-embed) for more details on\nthis feature.) Copy the \"Direct URL\" shown in the box that you can now see on\nthe screen. This should look something like this:\n`https://<YOUR_USERNAME>-<SPACE_NAME>.hf.space`.

Users can download files stored on the Hub from your library with `hf_hub_download`, create repositories with `create_repo`, and upload files with `upload_file`. You also set up Inference API with your library, allowing users to interact with your models on the Hub from inside a browser.\n\n## Document your library\n\nFinally, you can add your library to the Hub's documentation. Check for example the [Setfit PR](https://github.com/huggingface/hub-docs/pull/1150) that added [SetFit](./setfit) to the documentation.",

Everything is summarized at the end of the guide to help you choose\nbetween the two. Please keep in mind that these are only guidelines that you are free to adapt to you requirements.\n\nIf you are interested in Inference and Widgets, you can follow [this guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-adding-libraries#set-up-the-inference-api).\nIn both cases, you can reach out to us if you are integrating a library with the Hub and want to be listed\n[in our docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-libraries).\n\n## A flexible approach: helpers",

See [here](./model-cards) for more details about how to create a model card.\n\n## Set up the Inference API\n\nOur Inference API powers models uploaded to the Hub through your library.\n\n### Create an Inference API Docker image \n\nAll third-party libraries are Dockerized, so you can install the dependencies you'll need for your library to work correctly. Add your library to the existing Docker images by navigating to the [Docker images folder](https://github.com/huggingface/api-inference-community/tree/main/docker_images).",

Failing to do so can lead to unexpected results!\nFor instance, taking an audio sample with a sampling rate of 16kHz and listening \nto it with a sampling rate of 8kHz will make the audio sound as though it's in half-speed. \nIn the same way, passing audio with the wrong sampling rate can falter an ASR model \nthat expects one sampling rate and receives another.

The highlights of this project are:\n- initialize and train a GPT-2 language model from scratch for code generation\n- train a custom tokenizer adapted for Python code\n- clean and deduplicate a large (>100GB) dataset with `datasets`\n- train with `accelerate` on multiple GPUs using data parallelism and mixed precision\n- continuously push checkpoints to the hub with `huggingface_hub`\n- stream the dataset with `datasets` during training to avoid disk bottlenecks",

Using \ud83e\udd17 Accelerate we built a training script with less than 200 lines of code that we can effortlessly scale across many GPUs. With that you can now train your own GPT-2 model!\n\nThis post gives a brief overview of CodeParrot \ud83e\udd9c, but if you are interested in diving deeper into how to pretrain this models, we recommend reading its dedicated chapter in the upcoming [book on Transformers and NLP](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098103231/). This chapter provides many more details around building custom datasets, design considerations when training a new tokenizer, and architecture choice.",

We evaluated the models on OpenAI's HumanEval benchmark that was introduced in the Codex paper. It measures the performance of code generation models on almost 200 coding challenges.\n\n![codeparrot](assets/40_codeparrot/humaneval.png)\n\nNote that we trained CodeParrot on roughly 25-30B tokens whereas GPT-neo was trained on 300B tokens and Codex on 300B (GPT-3 checkpoint) + 100B (code) tokens. So you definitely get a good bang for your buck here.",

It is computed using the [Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) between the two distributions of text in a quantized embedding space of a large language model.

      "For MAUVE to be large, the model distribution must be close to the human text distribution as seen by the embeddings. It is possible to have high-quality model text that still has a small MAUVE score (i.e., large gap) if it contains text about different topics/subjects, or uses a different writing style or vocabulary, or contains texts of a different length distribution. MAUVE summarizes the statistical gap (as measured by the large language model embeddings) --- this includes all these factors in addition to the quality-related aspects such as grammaticality.\n\nSee the [official implementation](https://github.com/krishnap25/mauve#best-practices-for-mauve) for more details about best practices. \n\n\n## Citation",

The dimension of that vector is defined by the architecture of the model, for the base BERT model, it is 768. These representations contain the value of a word; but contextualized. For example, the vector attributed to the word \"to\", isn't the representation of only the \"to\" word. It also takes into account the words around it, which we call the \u201ccontext\u201d",
      ". These vectors usually live in a high-dimensional space, so a similarity metric can be anything that measures some sort of distance between vectors. One popular metric is cosine similarity, which uses the angle between two vectors to measure how close they are. In this example, our embedding vectors live in 3D and we can see that the orange and grey vectors are close to each other and have a smaller angle. Now one problem we have to deal with is that Transformer models like BERT will actually return one embedding vector per token. For example in the sentence \"I took my dog for a walk\", we can expect several embedding vectors, one for each word. For example, here we can see the output of our model has produced 9 embedding vectors per sentence, and each vector has 384 dimensions",

A routing mechanism (top 1 in this case) associates each token to one of the expert, where each expert is a dense MLP. While switch transformers have a lot more weights than their equivalent dense models, the sparsity allows better scaling and better finetuning performance at scale.\nDuring a forward pass, only a fraction of the weights are used. The routing mechanism allows the model to select relevant weights on the fly which increases the model capacity without increasing the number of operations.\n\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:"

      "## THE EVOLUTION OF MODEL CARDS\n\nSince the proposal for model cards by Mitchell et al. in 2018, model cards have been adopted and adapted by various organisations, including by major technology companies and startups developing and hosting machine learning models[^5], researchers describing new techniques[^6], and government stakeholders evaluating models for various projects[^7]. Model cards also appear as part of AI Ethics educational toolkits, and numerous organisations and developers have created implementations for automating or semi-automating the creation of model cards. Appendix A provides a set of examples of model cards for various types of ML models created by different organisations (including model cards for large language models), model card generation tools, and model card educational tools.",
      "To work towards that goal, it is important to recognize the thoughtful, dedicated efforts that have helped model cards grow into what they are today, from the adoption of model cards as a standard practice at many large organisations to the development of sophisticated tools for hosting and generating model cards. Since model cards were proposed by Mitchell et al. (2018), the landscape of machine learning documentation has expanded and evolved. A plethora of documentation tools and templates for data, models, and ML systems have been proposed and have developed \u2013 reflecting the incredible work of hundreds of researchers, impacted community members, advocates, and other stakeholders. Important discussions about the relationship between ML documentation and theories of change in responsible AI have created continued important discussions, and at times, divergence",
      "The development of the model cards framework in 2018 was inspired by the major documentation framework efforts of Data Statements for Natural Language Processing ([Bender & Friedman, 2018](https://aclanthology.org/Q18-1041/)) and Datasheets for Datasets ([Gebru et al., 2018](https://www.fatml.org/media/documents/datasheets_for_datasets.pdf)). Since model cards were proposed, a number of other tools have been proposed for documenting and evaluating various aspects of the machine learning development cycle. These tools, including model cards and related documentation efforts proposed prior to model cards, can be contextualised with regard to their focus (e.g",
      "* They are interesting to teach people about new models\n* As a non-technical guy, the possibility of getting to know the model, to understand the basics of it, it's an opportunity for the author to disclose its innovation in a transparent & explainable (i.e. trustworthy) way.\n* I like interactive model cards with visuals and widgets that allow me to try the model without running any code.\n* What I like about good model cards is that you can find all the information you need about that particular model.\n* Model cards are revolutionary to the world of AI ethics. It's one of the first tangible steps in mitigating/educating on biases in machine learning. They foster greater awareness and accountability!\n* Structured, exhaustive, the more info the better.\n* It helps to get an understanding of what the model is good (or bad) at.\n* Conciseness and accessibility"

      "Supported Transformers & Diffusers Tasks\n\nInference Endpoints offers out-of-the-box support for Machine Learning tasks from the Transformers, Sentence-Transformers and Diffusers libraries. Below is a table of Hugging Face managed supported tasks for Inference Endpoint. These tasks don't require any form of code or [\u201ccustom container\u201d](/docs/inference-endpoints/guides/docs/guides/custom_container) to deploy an Endpoint. \nIf you want to customize any of the tasks below, or want to write your own custom task, check out the [\u201cCreate your own inference handler\u201d](/docs/inference-endpoints/guides/custom_handler) section for more information.",
      "Inference Endpoints allow us to write custom inference functions called [custom handlers](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/guides/custom_handler). These are particularly useful when a model is not supported out-of-the-box by the `transformers` high-level abstraction `pipeline`.\n\n`transformers` pipelines offer powerful abstractions to run inference with `transformers`-based models. Inference Endpoints leverage the pipeline API to easily deploy models with only a few clicks. However, Inference Endpoints can also be used to deploy models that don't have a pipeline, or even non-transformer models! This is achieved using a custom inference function that we call a [custom handler](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/guides/custom_handler).",
      "Add custom Dependencies\n\nInference Endpoints\u2019 base image includes all required libraries to run inference on \ud83e\udd17 Transformers models, but it also supports custom dependencies. This is useful if you want to:\n\n* [customize your inference pipeline](/docs/inference-endpoints/guides/custom_handler) and need additional Python dependencies\n* run a model which requires special dependencies like the newest or a fixed version of a library (for example, `tapas` (`torch-scatter`)).",
      "Send Requests to Endpoints\n\nYou can send requests to Inference Endpoints using the UI leveraging the Inference Widget or programmatically, e.g. with cURL, `@huggingface/inference`, `huggingface_hub` or any REST client. The Endpoint overview not only provides a interactive widget for you to test the Endpoint, but also generates code for `python`, `javascript` and `curl`. You can use this code to quickly get started with your Endpoint in your favorite programming language.\n\nBelow are also examples on how to use the `@huggingface/inference` library to call an inference endpoint.\n\n## Use the UI to send requests",
      "</Tip>\n\nInference Endpoints can be fully managed via API. The endpoints are documented with [Swagger](https://api.endpoints.huggingface.cloud/). The [`InferenceEndpoint`] class is a simple wrapper built on top on this API.\n\n## Methods\n\nA subset of the Inference Endpoint features are implemented in [`HfApi`]:",
      "In just a few clicks, Inference Endpoints let you deploy any hub model on secure and scalable infrastructure, hosted in your AWS or Azure region of choice. Additional settings include CPU and GPU hosting, built-in auto-scaling, and more. This makes finding the appropriate cost/performance ratio easy, with [pricing](https://huggingface.co/pricing#endpoints) starting as low as $0.06 per hour.\n\nInference Endpoints support three security levels:\n\n* Public: the endpoint runs in a public Hugging Face subnet, and anyone on the Internet can access it without any authentication.\n\n* Protected: the endpoint runs in a public Hugging Face subnet, and anyone on the Internet with the appropriate Hugging Face token can access it.",
      "Inference Endpoints Version\n\nHugging Face Inference Endpoints comes with a default serving container which is used for all [supported Transformers and Sentence-Transformers tasks](/docs/inference-endpoints/supported_tasks) and for [custom inference handler](/docs/inference-endpoints/guides/custom_handler) and implement batching.\nBelow you will find information about the installed packages and versions used.\n\nYou can always upgrade installed packages and a custom packages by adding a `requirements.txt` file to your model repository.

But of course, there\u2019s a lot happening in the background. What we really like about Evaluation on the Hub: it fits so neatly into the existing Hugging Face ecosystem, we almost had to do it. Users start on dataset pages, from where they can launch evaluations or see leaderboards. The model evaluation submission interface and the leaderboards are regular Hugging Face Spaces. The evaluation backend is powered by AutoTrain, which opens up a PR on the Hub for the given model\u2019s model card.",

However, based on the provided code snippets and documentation, it appears that you can convert an existing `Dataset` object to an `IterableDataset` using the `to_iterable_dataset()` method.\n\nIf you have multiple `IterableDataset` objects and want to combine them into a single one, you could use the `torch.utils.data.ConcatDataset` function from PyTorch. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nimport torch.utils.data as data\n\niterable_datasets = [iterable_dataset1, iterable_dataset2]  # assuming these are your IterableDatasets\nconcat_dataset = data.ConcatDataset(iterable_datasets)\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a PyTorch function and might not be directly related to the Datasets library.\n\nIf you're looking for a way to combine `IterableDataset` objects from the Datasets library, I couldn't find any specific method or function in the provided documentation.",
    "retrieved_docs": [
      "</Tip>\n\n## Convert from a Dataset\n\nIf you have an existing [`Dataset`] object, you can convert it to an [`IterableDataset`] with the [`~Dataset.to_iterable_dataset`] function. This is actually faster than setting the `streaming=True` argument in [`load_dataset`] because the data is streamed from local files.\n\n```py\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset\n\n# faster \ud83d\udc07\n>>> dataset = load_dataset(\"food101\")\n>>> iterable_dataset = dataset.to_iterable_dataset()",
      "To create an `IterableDataset` on the other hand, you must provide a \"lazy\" way to load the data.\nIn Python, we generally use generator functions. These functions `yield` one example at a time, which means you can't access a row by slicing it like a regular `Dataset`:\n```python\ndef my_generator(n):\n    for i in range(n):\n        yield {\"col_1\": i}\n\nmy_iterable_dataset = IterableDataset.from_generator(my_generator, gen_kwargs={\"n\": 10})\nfor example in my_iterable_dataset:\n    print(example)\n    break\n```\n\n## Loading local files entirely and progressively",
      "# slower \ud83d\udc22\n>>> iterable_dataset = load_dataset(\"food101\", streaming=True)\n```\n\nThe [`~Dataset.to_iterable_dataset`] function supports sharding when the [`IterableDataset`] is instantiated. This is useful when working with big datasets, and you'd like to shuffle the dataset or to enable fast parallel loading with a PyTorch DataLoader.\n\n```py\n>>> import torch\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset",
      "## Eager data processing and lazy data processing\n\nWhen you process a [`Dataset`] object using [`Dataset.map`], the entire dataset is processed immediately and returned.\nThis is similar to how `pandas` works for example.\n\n```python\nmy_dataset = my_dataset.map(process_fn)  # process_fn is applied on all the examples of the dataset\nprint(my_dataset[0])\n```\n\nOn the other hand, due to the \"lazy\" nature of an `IterableDataset`, calling [`IterableDataset.map`] does not apply your `map` function over the full dataset.\nInstead, your `map` function is applied on-the-fly.",
      ">>> dataset = dataset.cast_column(\"audio\", Audio(sampling_rate=16000))\n>>> dataset.features\n{'audio': Audio(sampling_rate=16000, mono=True, id=None)}\n```\n\n## Map\n\nSimilar to the [`Dataset.map`] function for a regular [`Dataset`], \ud83e\udd17  Datasets features [`IterableDataset.map`] for processing an [`IterableDataset`].\n[`IterableDataset.map`] applies processing on-the-fly when examples are streamed.\n\nIt allows you to apply a processing function to each example in a dataset, independently or in batches. This function can even create new rows and columns.",
      "Know your dataset\n\nThere are two types of dataset objects, a regular [`Dataset`] and then an \u2728 [`IterableDataset`] \u2728. A [`Dataset`] provides fast random access to the rows, and memory-mapping so that loading even large datasets only uses a relatively small amount of device memory. But for really, really big datasets that won't even fit on disk or in memory, an [`IterableDataset`] allows you to access and use the dataset without waiting for it to download completely!\n\nThis tutorial will show you how to load and access a [`Dataset`] and an [`IterableDataset`].\n\n## Dataset",
      "The following example demonstrates how to tokenize a [`IterableDataset`]. The function needs to accept and output a `dict`:\n\n```py\n>>> def add_prefix(example):\n...     example['text'] = 'My text: ' + example['text']\n...     return example\n```\n\nNext, apply this function to the dataset with [`IterableDataset.map`]:"

However, you don't necessarily want to use a larger rank because it increases the number of trainable parameters. To address this, [LoHa](https://huggingface.co/papers/2108.06098) (a method originally developed for computer vision) was applied to diffusion models where the ability to generate diverse images is an important consideration. LoHa should also work with general model types, but the embedding layers aren't currently implemented in PEFT.",

The rank is controlled by a method similar to singular value decomposition (SVD). The \u2206W is parameterized with two orthogonal matrices and a diagonal matrix which contains singular values. This parametrization method avoids iteratively applying SVD which is computationally expensive. Based on this method, the rank of \u2206W is adjusted according to an importance score. \u2206W is divided into triplets and each triplet is scored according to its contribution to model performance. Triplets with low importance scores are pruned and triplets with high importance scores are kept for finetuning.\n\n## Llama-Adapter",

      "### Language modeling\n\nLanguage modeling is a task that predicts a word in a sequence of text. It has become a very popular NLP task because a pretrained language model can be finetuned for many other downstream tasks. Lately, there has been a lot of interest in large language models (LLMs) which demonstrate zero- or few-shot learning. This means the model can solve tasks it wasn't explicitly trained to do! Language models can be used to generate fluent and convincing text, though you need to be careful since the text may not always be accurate.\n\nThere are two types of language modeling:\n\n* causal: the model's objective is to predict the next token in a sequence, and future tokens are masked\n\n    ```py\n    >>> from transformers import pipeline",

      "There have been significant advances in new Transformer and Diffuser machine learning models that process and generate text, audio, and images. However, most of these popular generative AI models are not publicly available, widening the gap of machine learning capabilities between the largest tech companies and everyone else. To counter this trend, AWS and Hugging Face are partnering to contribute next-generation models to the global AI community and democratize machine learning. Through the strategic partnership, Hugging Face will leverage AWS as a preferred cloud provider so developers in Hugging Face\u2019s community can access AWS\u2019s state-of-the-art tools (e.g., [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker), [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon",
      "Billing\n\nAt Hugging Face, we build a collaboration platform for the ML community (i.e., the Hub), and we **monetize by providing simple access to compute for AI**, with services like AutoTrain, Spaces and Inference Endpoints, directly accessible from the Hub, and billed by Hugging Face to the credit card on file.\n\nWe also partner with cloud providers, like [AWS](https://huggingface.co/blog/aws-partnership) and [Azure](https://huggingface.co/blog/hugging-face-endpoints-on-azure), to make it easy for customers to use Hugging Face directly in their cloud of choice. These solutions and usage are billed directly by the cloud provider. Ultimately we want people to be able to have great options to use Hugging Face wherever they build Machine Learning.",
      "A: A foundational goal for Hugging Face is to make the latest AI accessible to as many people as possible, whichever framework or development environment they work in. While we are focusing integration efforts with Amazon Web Services as our Preferred Cloud Provider, we will continue to work hard to serve all Hugging Face users and customers, no matter what compute environment they run on.",
      "Through this partnership, Hugging Face is leveraging Amazon Web Services as its Preferred Cloud Provider to deliver services to its customers.\n\nAs a first step to enable our common customers, Hugging Face and Amazon are introducing new Hugging Face Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) to make it easier than ever to train Hugging Face Transformer models in [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).\n\nTo learn how to access and use the new Hugging Face DLCs with the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK, check out the guides and resources below.",

      "and having implemented the \ud83e\udd17 Transformers' version of the tokenizer can be loaded as follows:\n\n[To be filled out by mentor]\n\nTo ensure that the tokenizer works correctly, it is recommended to first\ncreate a script in the original repository that inputs a string and\nreturns the `input_ids`. It could look similar to this (in pseudo-code):\n\n```bash\ninput_str = \"This is a long example input string containing special characters .$?-, numbers 2872 234 12 and words.\"\nmodel = [camelcase name of model]Model.load_pretrained_checkpoint(\"/path/to/checkpoint/\")\ninput_ids = model.tokenize(input_str)\n```",

      "The tokenizer is responsible for all the preprocessing the pretrained model expects and can be called directly on a single string (as in the above examples) or a list. It will output a dictionary that you can use in downstream code or simply directly pass to your model using the ** argument unpacking operator.",
      ". And if we continue to test the normalization of many other tokenizers associated to models that you can find on the Hub we can see that they also propose other normalizations. With the fast tokenizers, it is very easy to observe the normalization chosen for the currently loaded tokenizer. Indeed, each instance of a fast tokenizer has an underlying tokenizer from the Tokenizers library stored in the backend_tokenizer attribute. This object has itself a normalizer attribute that we can use thanks to the \"normalize_str\" method to normalize a string. It is thus very practical that this normalization which was used at the time of the training of the tokenizer was saved and that it applies automatically when you asks a trained tokenizer to tokenize a text",
      "### AutoTokenizer\n\nA tokenizer is responsible for preprocessing text into an array of numbers as inputs to a model. There are multiple rules that govern the tokenization process, including how to split a word and at what level words should be split (learn more about tokenization in the [tokenizer summary](./tokenizer_summary)). The most important thing to remember is you need to instantiate a tokenizer with the same model name to ensure you're using the same tokenization rules a model was pretrained with.\n\nLoad a tokenizer with [`AutoTokenizer`]:\n\n```py\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer",
      "<Youtube id=\"VFp38yj8h3A\"/>\n\nEach tokenizer works differently but the underlying mechanism remains the same. Here's an example using the BERT\ntokenizer, which is a [WordPiece](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08144.pdf) tokenizer:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import BertTokenizer\n\n>>> tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-cased\")\n\n>>> sequence = \"A Titan RTX has 24GB of VRAM\"\n```\n\nThe tokenizer takes care of splitting the sequence into tokens available in the tokenizer vocabulary.\n\n```python\n>>> tokenized_sequence = tokenizer.tokenize(sequence)\n```",
      "<Youtube id=\"VFp38yj8h3A\"/>\n\nTokenizers are one of the core components of the NLP pipeline. They serve one purpose: to translate text into data that can be processed by the model. Models can only process numbers, so tokenizers need to convert our text inputs to numerical data. In this section, we'll explore exactly what happens in the tokenization pipeline. \n\nIn NLP tasks, the data that is generally processed is raw text. Here's an example of such text:\n\n```\nJim Henson was a puppeteer\n```"

This is because there \nare many components during training that use GPU memory. The components on GPU memory are the following:\n\n1. model weights\n2. optimizer states\n3. gradients\n4. forward activations saved for gradient computation\n5. temporary buffers\n6. functionality-specific memory",

Informer uses a _Distilling_ operation, for reducing the input size between layers into its half slice. By doing so, it reduces the whole memory usage to be \\\\(O(N\\cdot T \\log T)\\\\).",

Chunked Feed Forward Layers\n\nTransformer-based models often employ very large feed forward layers after the self-attention layer in parallel. Thereby, this layer can take up a significant amount of the overall memory and sometimes even represent the memory bottleneck of a model.\nFirst introduced in the Reformer paper, feed forward chunking is a technique that allows to effectively trade better memory consumption for increased time consumption.\n\n\n### Chunked Feed Forward Layer in Reformer",

The Science Behind LLM Architectures: Strategic Selection for Long Text Inputs and Chat\n\nSo far we have looked into improving computational and memory efficiency by:\n\n-   Casting the weights to a lower precision format\n-   Replacing the self-attention algorithm with a more memory- and compute efficient version"

The memory optimizations enable ONNX Runtime to maximize the batch size and utilize the available memory efficiently whereas the compute optimizations speed up the training time. These optimizations include, but are not limited to, efficient memory planning, kernel optimizations, multi tensor apply for Adam Optimizer (which batches the elementwise updates applied to all the model\u2019s parameters into one or a few kernel launches), FP16 optimizer (which eliminates a lot of device to host memory copies), mixed precision training and graph optimizations like node fusions and node eliminations.

      "### Automatic speech recognition\n\nTo use the pretrained model for automatic speech recognition, add a language modeling head on top of the base Wav2Vec2 model for [connectionist temporal classification (CTC)](glossary#connectionist-temporal-classification-ctc). The language modeling head is a linear layer that accepts the encoder's hidden states and transforms them into logits. Each logit represents a token class (the number of tokens comes from the task vocabulary). The CTC loss is calculated between the logits and targets to find the most likely sequence of tokens, which are then decoded into a transcription.\n\nReady to try your hand at automatic speech recognition?

      ". Inputs and the labels will need to be padded if we want to join samples of variable length into the same minibatch, and that's exactly what the data collators will do. The final data collator I want to show you is the DataCollatorForLanguageModeling. It's very important, firstly because language models are so foundational to everything we do in NLP, and secondly because it has two modes that do two very different things. You choose which mode you want with the mlm argument - set it to True for masked language modeling, and False for causal language modeling. Collating data for causal language modeling is actually quite straightforward - the model is just making predictions for what token comes next, so your labels are more or less just a copy of your inputs, and the collator handles that and ensures your inputs and labels are padded correctly",
      "Fine-tuning a masked language model is almost identical to fine-tuning a sequence classification model, like we did in [Chapter 3](/course/chapter3). The only difference is that we need a special data collator that can randomly mask some of the tokens in each batch of texts. Fortunately, \ud83e\udd17 Transformers comes prepared with a dedicated `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` for just this task. We just have to pass it the tokenizer and an `mlm_probability` argument that specifies what fraction of the tokens to mask. We'll pick 15%, which is the amount used for BERT and a common choice in the literature:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling",
